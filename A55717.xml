            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Need not pretend to apologize for the publiſhing this ſmall Piece at a time when the continued Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories of the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> over that once ſo formidable Enemy the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the preſent War with the <hi>French,</hi> has made that Nation the Subject of all our Converſation and Diſcourſe for ſo many years: and our preſent Union with thoſe Princes in a War that is of ſo great conſequence in the event, be it what it will, is like to make this Country more the Subject of our Hopes and Fears now, than ever it was before.</p>
            <p>It is natural for men to be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know the Circumſtances of thoſe they are concern'd with; and there is nothing excites our Curioſity ſo much, as the conſidering our own Happineſs or Miſery is wrapt up in the
<pb facs="tcp:54100:4"/>
Fate of another. Our Regards for the Empire of <hi>China</hi> are very languid, and we read their Story and Deſcriptions with little more attention than we do a well-drawn Romance, becauſe be they true or falſe, we are nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Fortunes of that remote Empire, which can have no influence upon our Nation.</p>
            <p>If the World deſires it, it will not be difficult to give a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Electors, and of the other Princes and Free Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> but without that, this will be ſufficient to ſhew the general State of <hi>Germany,</hi> which is the thing we <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> are moſt deſirous and concerned to know.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make no other Apology for it, becauſe I am beforehand reſolved to be wholly unconcerned for its fate; the Reader is left entirely to his own liberty, to think and ſpeak of it as he himſelf pleaſe.</p>

preſent <hi>Finlanders</hi> have a Tongue ſo different from that ſpoken by the <hi>Swedes</hi> and other <hi>Germans,</hi> as clearly ſhews that Nation to be of another extraction. To this I may add, that what <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes of the Manners of the moſt <hi>Northern Germans,</hi> will not all agree with the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> but is wonderfully agreeable to thoſe of the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> who to this day live much after the ſame manner. It is probable therefore, that the <hi>Finni</hi> mentioned by the Ancients were the <hi>Eſtoitlanders</hi> in <hi>Livonia.</hi> Nor is it any wonder that <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſhould not write very diſtinctly of this People, they being then the moſt Northern Nation that was ever heard of, and known only by an obſcure Fame or general Report. Theſe Northern Countries have however for many Ages been under diſtinct Kings of their own, ſo that <hi>Germany</hi> has been taken to reach only to the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea; and even here the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> has deprived it of a conſiderable part of the Promontory of <hi>Jutland,</hi> which he claims as a part of his Kingdom, tho' it lieth on this ſide of the <hi>Sound</hi> or Mouth of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea.

and Nations, who were much celebrated on the account of their numbers and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; yet each of them was under a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Regiment, very different from that uſed by their Neighbours, but then they had one common Original, and the ſame Language; and there was a great ſimilitude in their Manners. The greateſt part of them were under popular Governments; ſome had Kings, but that were rather to perſwade their Subjects by their Authority, than to command them by the Soveraign Power; for that Nation was never able to brook an Abſolute Servitude. This Ancient <hi>Germany</hi> was never reduced into one Empire or Kingdom, wherein it was like the reſt of her Neighbours, <hi>Italy, France, Spain, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> before they were conquered by the <hi>Romans.</hi> But then, as <hi>Germany</hi> never was reduced by a Conqueſt, ſo it retained more lively traces and marks of the Primitive State of Mankind, which from ſeparate and diſtinct Families by degrees united into lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Bodies or Kingdoms. But then, tho' <note place="margin">

                  </note> this Independent Knot of States and ſmall Kingdoms, by reaſon of its freedom, was very grateful to the <hi>Germans</hi> of thoſe times, yet it was abſolutely neceſſary they ſhould frequently be engaged in mutual and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Wars, when they were ſo many and ſo ſmall. This again expoſed them to the Invaſions of their neighbour Nations, though they were a warlike People, becauſe their ſcattered Forces were not united in one Empire for their defence. Neither had the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54100:11"/>
greateſt part of theſe ſmall States ſo much Politicks as in due time to unite in Leagues againſt the dangers of their potent Enemies; but they perceived the Benefit of ſuch a Concord, when it was too late, and they by fighting ſeparately for their Liberty, were one after another all conquered.</p>

them: But then the <hi>Franks</hi> brought their German Tongue along with them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt did not preſently forget it. But then, as the <hi>Franks</hi> neither deſtroyed nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the <hi>Gauls,</hi> but only aſſumed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Soveraignity of the Country, from whence it came to paſs, that thoſe who were deſcended of the <hi>Franks,</hi> were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the great Affairs, and the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as a conquered People, were kept under; but then as two Rivers of different colour, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in one ſtream, may for ſome time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve each his proper colour, but at length the greater ſtream will certainly change the leſter into its own colour; ſo in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Gauls</hi> had their Tongue, and the <hi>Franks</hi> theirs, till in length of time a third was made out of both mixed and twiſted together, in which yet the <hi>Latin</hi> is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, the plain cauſe of which is, That the <hi>Gauls</hi> were more numerous than the <hi>Franks,</hi> and it was much harder for them to learn the <hi>German,</hi> than it was for the <hi>Franks</hi> to learn the <hi>Gallick</hi> Latin; for with what difficulty Foreigners learn the German Tongue, I my ſelf know by experience. From hence it proceeds, that the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers of this Nation call the vulgar Latin the Ruſtick or Countryman's Tongue, becauſe the Nobility and Gentry ſtill uſed the German, whilſt the Countrymen and the reſt of the <hi>Gauls</hi> had no knowledge of any other than the Latin. And thus we ſee it is in our own times, in <hi>Livonia</hi> and <hi>Curland,</hi> where the old Inhabitants are by the <hi>Germans</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54100:14"/>
reduced into the condition of meer Ruſticks; for all the Nobility, and the Inhabitants of the Cities, ſpeak the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Tongue, and the <hi>German,</hi> but the Countrymen do ſcarce underſtand one German word of ten. Thus <hi>Charles</hi> the Great might eaſily underſtand the German Tongue, becauſe the <hi>Franks,</hi> who were a German Nation, had not quite laid aſide the uſe of it; and alſo becauſe the <hi>Franks,</hi> before his time, had conquered a great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and he went on with the work, and reduced all the reſt under his Dominion. Nor was it poſſible in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Age to converſe with the <hi>Germans</hi> in any other than their own Language. But then he that obſerves, that there is two very different Queſtions confounded into one, will very accurately determine this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; for if the Queſtion be, Whether <hi>Charles</hi> the Great were of a <hi>Gallick</hi> or a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Original? without doubt it will be anſwered, That he was not a <hi>Gaul</hi> but a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or which is all one, a <hi>Frank.</hi> But if the Queſtion be, What Countryman he was? <hi>France,</hi> and not <hi>Germany,</hi> is to be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. and therefore in this reſpect he was no <hi>German,</hi> but a <hi>Gaul,</hi> or <hi>Gallo-Frank.</hi> I fear I ſhall make the Reader think I take him for a ſtupid perſon, if I ſhould dwell any longer on ſo plain a thing; and yet I will preſume to give the <hi>Germans</hi> a known example<hi>:</hi> If you fall upon a Nobleman of <hi>Livonia,</hi> and ask him what Countryman he is, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Livonian,</hi> and not a <hi>German;</hi> but then, if you ſtill inſiſt, and ask him of what Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54100:14"/>
he will ſay, he is deſcended of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and not of the <hi>Livonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. This Prince <hi>(Charles</hi> the Great) had <note place="margin">

                  </note> under him divers Nations, which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by very different Titles: He enjoy'd <hi>France</hi> as his Inheritance, devolved to him from his Father by Succeſſion. For though we read in their Hiſtories, that the ancient <hi>Franks</hi> had lodged in the Nobility and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Nation, ſome Authority in the conſtituting their Kings; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it was rather a ſolemn Inaguration, and an acknowledgment of their Loyalty and Obedience to the new King, than a Free Election; for they rarely departed from the Order of a Lineal Succeſſion, but when there were Factions, or the next Heir in the Line was wholly unfit for Government. A part of <hi>Germany</hi> was, before this time, united by Conqueſt to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the reſt of it was ſubdued by the victorious Arms of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. Whether any part of this Country freely and willingly ſubmitted to him out of Reverence to his Greatneſs, is very uncertain. He alſo by his Arms conquered the Kingdom of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> affording him a Pretence for it; after which, he was by the Pope and People of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaluted <hi>Emperor of Rome,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Now, what he gain'd by this Title, we ſhall by and by inform you.</p>
               <p>8. Thus, under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, <hi>Germany</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Germany <hi>a part of the Kingdom of</hi> France.</note> became a part of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and was ſufficiently ſubject to the Abſolute Empire or Soveraignty of thoſe Princes.

During this ſtate of Affairs, it was divided into divers Provinces, which were governed by <hi>Counts</hi> or <hi>Earls,</hi> and <hi>Marqueſſes,</hi> who were for the moſt part of French extraction: yet in theſe times the <hi>Saxons</hi> enjoy'd a greater ſhew of Liberty, becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> the Great had not been able to reduce them without a long and tedious War, and was at laſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Work, and eſtabliſh his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, neceſſitated to admit them to a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Priviledges enjoy'd by the <hi>Franks,</hi> and to unite them into one Nation with their Conquerors.

On this account many Biſhopricks and Abbies in <hi>Germany</hi> were founded by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. <hi>Germany</hi> was in the ſame eſtate under Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles,</hi> but that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prefects or Governours of the Provinces began to grow greater.</p>

few over-potent Citizens engaged in Civil Wars, and at length brought under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a ſingle perſon. But then <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> the Founder of the Roman Empire (or Monarchy) when he had by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Army gained the Empire, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelf, that he ſhould eaſily keep it by the ſame way. Therefore tho' from thenceforward he ſeemed to leave ſome of the Affairs of the State to the diſpoſal of the <hi>Senate,</hi> that it might ſtill ſeem to have a ſhare in the Government; yet he wholly kept in his own hands the Care and Government of the Army. But then it was his principal care to conceal from the Rabble of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, That the Souldiers were the men who could ſet up and pull down the Emperors; which Secret, when it was once diſcovered, the State of the Empire became as miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Condition of the Emperors; for the Empire being weakened by frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Wars, found it ſelf alſo often expoſed to the worſt of men by a covetous and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Rabble, which oftentimes moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly murdered her beſt Princes, to her great damage and ſorrow: Nor could any of her Emperors after this entertain any hopes of firmly ſettling the Empire in their Families, but was neceſſitated to be contented with a precarious Title amongſt a parcel of merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Souldiers: So that in truth the whole power of making the Emperors, was in the Army, (which is the common Attendant of all Military Monarchies, where a ſtrong and perpetual Army is kept together in any one

place) and the <hi>Senate and People of Rome</hi> were weak and vain Names, made uſe of to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the ſimple common People, as if the free and voluntary conſent of the whole Body had conſtituted the Emperor. That Kingdom, thus founded on a Military Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as it was unfit for continuance, was by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to its fatal period: the firſt of theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Byzantium</hi> (now called <hi>Conſtantinople)</hi> the Seat of the Empire, and withdrawing the Armies, which had till then been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on the Eaſt of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> for its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and the later by dividing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire between his two Sons <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius,</hi> ſoft laſie Princes, and neither of them fit for ſuch a Command.

But however, the Supremacy was acknowledged to be in the Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> who exerciſed it in <hi>Rome</hi> and thoſe other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Juriſdiction by his <hi>Exarchs.</hi> But by degrees the <hi>Popes</hi> became weary of this <hi>Greek Empire;</hi> they lay the blame however on the Miſgovernment of the <hi>Exarchs,</hi> and becauſe ſome of the Greek Emperors were too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt Images, which they yet judged a moſt uſeful Tool to inſtruct the <hi>Many</hi> in the Superficial Rites of Religion, which, as they ſaid, was become incapable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or bearing a more ſolid Piety; nor was it ſo profitable to the Prieſts, to let the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple know, a good and holy Life would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly pleaſe God. Perhaps alſo it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the Church would be very much exalted in her Authority, if the Pope could by degrees gain the Secular Empire, as he had already, in a good degree, aſſumed the Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical or Sacred Affairs throughout the World. And in truth, it did not ſeem fit that he ſhould live in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Slave of a Greek Emperor, (who ſometimes was deprived of his Virili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) whom God had intruſted with ſuch Power, as his own <hi>Vicar</hi> in the World, that he being freed from the Care of the Church, might be at the better leiſure to attend the Civil Affairs of the World, and that they too had been delegated by God to the Pope, if it had not been apparent, that the holy

                  </note> the Greek Emperor was not much feared, both on the ſcore of his diſtance, and alſo becauſe he had enough to do to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> which then from the Eaſt fiercely and ſucceſsfully attack'd the Empire; yet the Power of the <hi>Lombards</hi> was more dreadful, and hung like a mighty Tempeſt over all <hi>Italy,</hi> and had almoſt made themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Pope not being able alone to grapple with this Enemy, could bethink him of no body that was able to ſuccour the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in this exigence, but the King of <hi>France;</hi> and he too was very much diſpoſed to it by the Proſpect of that Glory which would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the reſcuing from Injury that Perſon, who like an unexhauſtible Fountain diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all Chriſtian Souls the Waters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace.

The Emp. of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> who was then weak, and needed the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Charles</hi> yielded the point without any difficulty, to preſerve <hi>Calabria,</hi> and thoſe other Ports he had yet left him in <hi>Italy.</hi> So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Now whether this Defence and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection included in it a Supreme Empire or Dominion over that See, as ſome <hi>Civilians</hi> have ſaid, ſeems a doubt to me, and I ſhould rather think there was a kind of unequal League only entred between <hi>Charles</hi> and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> That he ſhould defend her againſt all Invaders, or by his Authority compoſe all internal Commotions, which might tend to the damage or diſhonour of that See; and on the other ſide, the See of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould pay a due reſpect to his Majeſty, and not undertake any thing which was of great conſequence, without his Authority or Leave: and in the firſt place, that no man ſhould be admitted Pope againſt his will. From whence it will appear, that the See of <hi>Rome</hi> from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward became a particular State, and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, was not united to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France.</hi> And that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was not the Maſter of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the States belonging to it, nor did he exerciſe a Soveraign Dominion over her, by making Laws, impoſing Tributes, creating Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, or exerciſing any Juriſdiction, or the like; for all theſe things are not above the Pretences of an Advocate, <hi>viz.</hi> To expel a Pope that entered by ill Arts, to reduce into

But then, after many of thoſe old German Kings had couragiouſly executed that Office upon the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the mean time the Wealth and Power not only of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of the Biſhopricks of <hi>Germany,</hi> was become very great, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> began to grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

of this German Protection too; the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this were, 1. The Averſion common to all Nations, againſt a Foreign Dominion. 2.

Place of the old Roman Empire, and that it is continued in this Kingdom; when in truth, that Empire which was ſeated at <hi>Rome,</hi> was deſtroyed many Ages before <hi>Germany</hi> became one Kingdom; and that Roman Empire which was given to <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Otho</hi> (which was nothing but the Advouſion and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the See of <hi>Rome)</hi> in length of time fixed its Name upon that Kingdom of <hi>Germany,</hi> tho' the States of the Church in <hi>Italy</hi> never were united into one and the ſame Polity with the Kingdom of <hi>Germany,</hi> much leſs did either <hi>Charles</hi> or <hi>Otho</hi> ſubmit their proper Kingdoms to <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Metropolis or Seat of the Empire. In the mean time, becauſe it was believed the very Title of <hi>Emperor of Rome,</hi> upon the account of the Greatneſs of that ancient Empire, had ſomething of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Grandeur in it, it was frequently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Kings of <hi>Germany</hi> only. And the conſequence of this was, that <hi>Germany</hi> was afterwards call'd the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> by way of Honour; but the different Coronations which belong to them do not obſcurely ſhew, that there is a real difference to be made between the Roman Empire and the Kingdom of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> and the later Emperors, ſince <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> I. after the Title of <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſubjoin that of <hi>King of Germany.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> alſo at this day do commonly call their State, <hi>The Roman Empire of the Teutonick Nation;</hi> which form of Speech ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it a contradiction.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54100:20"/>
yet the Kings of <hi>Germany</hi> retain the Title which has been received, tho' they have for a long time omitted the Reception of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and uſe very little of the ancient Rights of an Advocate, which belonged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to them, becauſe Princes do more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily part with the things in diſpute, than with the Titles to them. Now, whether that Right they once had, is by the lapſe of time expir'd, or preſerved by the uſe of the Title only, we ſhall hereafter, when occaſion is offered, enquire.</p>
               <p>15. But in the mean time the Title of the <note place="margin">

I ſhould think, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Princes heaped their Bounties upon the Clergy of <hi>Germany,</hi> principally becauſe they were made believe God expected they ſhould provide plentifully for that Order of Men. And what has been ſpent by <hi>Germans</hi> in Journies to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Imperial Crown? What Treaſures and Men have been conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in <hi>Italick</hi> Expeditions, in compoſing the Commotions ſtirr'd up by the Popes, and in protecting them againſt refractory men that have attack'd them, is not to be conceived.

from it, and either annexed to other Kingdoms, or formed into ſeparate and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent States. How much the German Empire is now leſs than it was anciently, has been ſhewn by <hi>Hermannus Conringius,</hi> a moſt skilful man in the German Affairs, in his Book, <hi>de finibus Imperii Germanici, concerning the Bounds of the German Empire;</hi> but it will be enough for us to obſerve what ſhe has at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The principal Members then of this Body are deſigned by the Title of <hi>The States of the Empire,</hi> who have, as we expreſs it, a Right to Sit and Vote in the <hi>Diet,</hi> tho' many of theſe are oppoſed by others, or whoſe Right to be immediate States is diſputed by other more potent States, who pretend they ought to repreſent them in the <hi>Diet.</hi> The occaſion of theſe Controverſies is, becauſe theſe Potent States would make thoſe that are controverted Members of their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial States, and not of the general <hi>Diet.</hi> But then, as to the Families of the Princes, it is to be obſerved, that there regularly belongs to each Houſe a certain number of Votes in the <hi>Diet;</hi> as ſome Houſes have only one Vote, ſome two, ſome three, ſome four, and ſome five; in ſome Principalities the eldeſt Brother enjoys the whole Eſtate, and all the younger muſt be content with an <hi>Apanage,</hi> and in others, they have all a ſhare, though not an equal one, with the eldeſt; where the firſt of theſe is obſerved, the eldeſt repreſents the Perſon of the whole Family; where the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they may all come to the <hi>Diet,</hi> but they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54100:22"/>
have altogether but one Vote, of which they muſt all agree amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prove a Perſon a Member of the <note place="margin">Which are the Members of the Empire.</note> States of the Empire, two things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought ſufficient, 1. if his Name is in the Catalogue or <hi>Matricula</hi> of the States; and 2. if he is obliged to pay what he contributes to the Publick, to the Empire, and not into the Exchequer or Treaſury of any other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate State; tho' the plaineſt Proof is, to alledge the Poſſeſſion of this Priviledge. Some pretend they have by miſtake paid their <hi>quota</hi> into other inferiour States; and others ſay, that ſome others, by meer Uſurpation, have paſſed by the Provincial Treaſury to which they belonged of Right, and have flown with their ſhare to the publick Treaſury; and theſe Allegations are made, as men endeavour to acquire or deprive others of the Right of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Members of the <hi>Diet</hi> reſpectively. Nor was there ever yet any <hi>Matricula</hi> extant, in which nothing was wanting or redundant, and about which there was not ſome Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; tho' thoſe that were publiſhed in the year 51, 56, 66. of the laſt Century, are thought the moſt authentick. But I ſhould however think, that the moſt ancient <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi>'s which repreſent many as Parts of the States of the Empire, who have been long ſince excluded out of the <hi>Diet,</hi> are better than the latter, becauſe they are nothing but Liſts of thoſe who were then in the <hi>Diet,</hi> when publick Inſtruments were made by publick Authority; and therefore from thence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Arguments may be made for both the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54100:22"/>
contending Parties. But in the mean time, from this variety in the <hi>Matricula</hi>'s I may ſafely conclude, That in the moſt ancient times the number of the States of the Empire was never fixed and certain, and that all that were enabled by their Wealth or Prudence, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing to the Welfare of their Country, had liberty to be preſent in the <hi>Diet.</hi> Afterwards the Poorer not being able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>Diet,</hi> by reaſon of the Expence and Charge, remained willingly at home; and that in after-times others, who would willingly enough have been there, were excluded by others, who were too powerful for them to contend with, till the States were by degrees brought to the number we now ſee them. It were too tedious for us to tranſcribe here a <hi>Matricula,</hi> but yet I ſhall repreſent the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of the States, as a thing abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the forming a Judgment of the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this whole Body.</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54100:23"/>
of about 20 years. The State of <hi>Germany</hi> was in great confuſion and diſorder; the principal Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> met, and to put an end to theſe Calamities, reſolved to elect an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; <hi>Wernerus,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> who had civilly waited upon him in one of his Journeys to <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> to the <hi>Alps,</hi> and he much extolled his Prudence and Courage, and the Electors of <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Trier</hi> ſoon joined with him. Now he that is any thing well acquainted with the Temper of the Churchmen, will, without any difficulty, conjecture what occaſion'd this great deſire in the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> to raiſe this Gentleman; he concluded, he would be the more obnoxious or compliant to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Nobility of his extraction did not encourage him to act with that freedom ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have uſed; and beſides, he would in greater degree be obliged to him for his preferment. But then it might ſeem a wonder that none of the greater Princes ſhould aſpire to the Imperial Throne, except we conſider the confuſed ſtate of things in <hi>Germany,</hi> at that time, which made them all fearful they might not be able to reduce it into order; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps others of them were not of ſufficient age and experience to effect ſo difficult a Work. Thus the Secular Electors complied with the Spiritual; but then the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Burgrave of <hi>Norimburg,</hi> would not give their Votes for him till he had promiſed them each of them a Daughter in Marriage; and the ſame was asked by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who was then preſent, and granted. Thus <hi>Rudol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>

became allied to the beſt Families of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> which in the beginning was both an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and a ſupport to this Houſe. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Dignity gave him alſo afterwards op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of obtaining a conſiderable Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for his Poſterity; for when any Fee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vacant, none could better pretend to it than one of his own Sons, for to take it to himſelf, would have been very invidious. Thus <note place="margin">Auſtria, Stiria, Carniola, <hi>&amp;c. came into this Houſe as vacant Fees.</hi>
                  </note> that Houſe obtained <hi>Auſtria, Stiria, Carniola,</hi> and the Marquiſate of <hi>Vindiſh</hi> in <hi>Carniola,</hi> and ſome other Territories, and in proceſs of time many other were added, by the Bounty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperors, as the Opulent are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obliged with ſuch Favours than the Poor. Being thus enriched, it became very eaſie for this Family to match into the beſt Houſes; and becauſe Ladies are not only won by Riches, but dazzled ſometimes with the glittering of a new and extraordinary Title, a Son might eaſily gain in that caſe, from a leſs yielding Father, ſome new additions, which might ſet him above the other Dukes, and yet even here the Prudence of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> deſerves commendation. It would have been very invidious for this new Family to have taken a <hi>Place</hi> in the <hi>Diets,</hi> above the more ancient; and yet it did not become it to follow the reſt, now it was poſſeſſed of the Empire; therefore they took the firſt place amongſt the <hi>Spiritual Electors,</hi> who have a Bench diſtinct <note place="margin">The firſt amongſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Electors.</note> from the <hi>Secular Princes;</hi> for theſe being for the moſt part deſcended of lower Families, did without any reluctance yield the firſt place to this Family; and yet this their modeſty went

not unrewarded for on this account they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that Employment or Honour which they call the <hi>Directory</hi> in the Colledge of the Princes, to be exerciſed by turns with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Saliburg.</hi> Theſe things are ſo far from deſerving the blame of any wiſe man, that it would have been the utmoſt degree of ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to have done otherwiſe. Thus the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> gained to it ſelf the greateſt part of the Eaſtern Countries of <hi>Germany;</hi> after this, they got the Crown of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by almoſt an Hereditary Title, which amongſt other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſerves as a Bulwark to their other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions againſt the Irruptions of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and give the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> many pretences of drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moneys of <hi>Germany</hi> to maintain its Wars againſt that dreadful Enemy.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

ſo great a part of its body, but would alſo ſet a dangerous Example to other powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to do the like, eſpecially if they conceive they are able to preſerve themſelves without the aſſiſtance of the Empire; yea, if this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample were once given, the meaner and leſſer Princes would not continue in the ſtate of Subjects. And thus <hi>Germany</hi> would ſoon be brought into the ſame ſtate with <hi>Italy;</hi> but then it ſeems to me to be very doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it could ſo well preſerve it ſelf as <hi>Italy</hi> doth. That I have not raſhly feigned all this, will be eaſily granted, if any one is but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſider, That the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> has very little concern with the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> beſides its Vote in the Election of the Emperor; or if he will but reflect on the greateſt part of the Priviledges of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> It will to this purpoſe be ſufficient to repreſent a few Heads of the Immunities given by <hi>Charles</hi> V. In the very entrance of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Priviledges granted to this Family by</hi> Charles <hi>V.</hi>
                  </note> this Grant he is pleaſed to acknowledge, that Men naturally deſire the welfare of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; then he decrees, That <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſhall be a perpetual Fee of this Family, which no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Emperor ſhall deprive it off. 2. That the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> for the time being, ſhall be ſuch a Counſellor of the Empire, as without his knowledge nothing ſhall be determined. And yet, 3. He declares his Dominions free from all Contributions to the Empire. 4. And yet obligeth the Empire to the defence of them; ſo that in all Advantages it is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in all Charges it is not. 5. The Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſhall not be obliged to demand the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of his Dominions out of the Bounds

of them, but it ſhall be offered to him in his own Territories; to wit, becauſe for a naked acknowledgment of the Tenure, he will not confeſs himſelf ſubject to the Empire; or as if he were to be intreated to own himſelf a Vaſſal of the Empire. And then the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are allowed him in this action, do alſo ſufficiently argue, that he is to be treated like an Equal, and not like a Subject. 6. If he pleaſe, he may come to the <hi>Diet;</hi> and if he pleaſe, he may forbear. 7. The <hi>Emperor</hi> has no Authory to rectifie any thing done by him in his own Dominions. 8. The Emperor can diſpoſe of no Fees within the Dominions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Houſe of <hi>Austria.</hi> 9. His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhall not be drawn out of his Dominions to anſwer in any other Courts. 10. From his Sentence there lies no Appeal. 11. He may without any danger receive ſuch as are put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Ban</hi> of the Empire, ſo that he take care to do Juſtice to the Party injured; but then thoſe that are baniſhed by the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſhall be abſolved by no other Prince, nor in any other place than in <hi>Auſtria.</hi> 12. He may lay new Tributes or Taxes on his own Vaſſals, at his own pleaſure. 13. He may create Earls, Barons, and Gentlemen within his own Dominions, which was heretofore thought one of the Acts of Soveraignty. 14. Laſtly, to perfect his Power, it is decreed, That in caſe the Male Line fail in this Houſe, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates belonging to it ſhall devolve to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>male Iſſue; and if there be no Females, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the laſt Poſſeſſor ſhall give or diſpoſe of them as he thinks fit. It is to no purpoſe to add any more, ſeeing theſe are ſufficient to

convince any wiſe man. So that the man muſt be very ſilly who doth not perceive the <hi>ſham</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the Empire by <hi>Charles</hi> V. when he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his 17 Provinces to the Empire, with a <note place="margin">

                  </note> magnificent Promiſe, that they ſhould pay as much as any two of the Electors paid to the Charges of the Empire; for he well conſidered that all was to be ſpent on the <hi>Turkiſh War,</hi> and the Preſervation of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Dominions: and when the Accounts of the Moneys expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Turkiſh War</hi> were to be in the hands of the Princes of this <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Familys, the <hi>Low Countries</hi> were not likely to be overcharged, nor to be very ill treated, if they proved ſlow in the payment. So that it was eaſie to obſerve, That <hi>Charles</hi> V. by this Promiſe only encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Germans</hi> to ſpend their Treaſures the more freely in the defence of his Territories, when they ſaw him ſo freely conſent to bring his own Patrimony under the ſame Burthen; tho' perhaps there might be another reaſon too at the bottom of it, <hi>viz. That whereas his Son</hi> Philip <hi>then aſpired to the Empire, it might not be objected againſt him, that he had no Dominions in the Empire, thoſe belonging before to the Houſe of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>being then aſſigned to his Brother</hi> Ferdinand: Or, perhaps, that the <hi>Germans</hi> might think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the more obliged to defend theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, if they were at any time invaded by the French King.

their Power and Authority over their Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals is of the ſame nature; and many of them are alſo more fond of their <hi>Helmets</hi> than their <hi>Miters,</hi> and are much fitter to involve their Country in Wars, and their Neighbours in Troubles, than to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate true Piety.

FOR the attaining an accurate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the German Empire, it is abſolutely neceſſary to enquire by what ſteps thoſe that are called the States of the Empire arrived to the Power they now poſſeſs; for without this it will not be poſſible to ſee what was the true cauſe that this State took ſuch an irregular form. Now theſe States are Secular Princes, Earls, Biſhops, and Cities, of the Riſe of each of which we will diſcourſe briefly. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes are Dukes or Earls, who have <note place="margin">

Lives, and the Son for the moſt part ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Father: So that having ſo fair an opportunity in their hands, of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, they began to look on their Provinces as their Patrimony and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.

Thus we uſually take more care of what is our own, than of what belongs to another: But then a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not give his Eſtate to his Tenant, that he may uſe it ſo much the better. There is a cheaper way of preventing the Rebellions of <hi>Preſidents,</hi> than that of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces to them, to be adminiſtred as an Inheritance. And 'tis a very ſilly thing to meaſure the Majeſty of a Prince, by the number of thoſe in his Dominions, who can with ſafety deſpiſe him and his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.

After theſe Beginnings or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, Princes encreaſed their Power af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by Purchaces, by Hereditary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents, not only in the Right of Blood; but <note place="margin">Others by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace, Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,</note> alſo by mutual Pacts of Succeſſions, which the <hi>Germans</hi> call, <hi>Confraternal Inheritances or Succeſſions,</hi> which are of the ſame nature with that League between the potent Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Saxony, Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Haſſia,</hi> which is now in force: And by vertue of ſuch a League, the Dukes of <hi>Saxony</hi> obtained the Earldom of <hi>Henneberg,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> the Right of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> though that League was not reciprocal; and yet it is apparent, theſe Leagues are injurious to the Emperor, who has the Right of a Lord over the Dominions of the Princes, and ought, upon a vacancy, to diſpoſe of the Fee. Laſtly, Some Eſtates have been ſeized by force, by ſome of them, when <hi>Germany</hi> was involved in Wars and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then, in after times, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In after times theſe Powers were confirmed by the</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</note> that the Power which theſe Princes had once gotten, could not be diſſolved without diſtracting all <hi>Germany,</hi> and perhaps not ſo neither, without hazarding the Ruin of him that ſhould attempt it, it ſeemed better to the ſucceeding Kings, eſpecially
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54100:37"/>
after they ſaw they could not obtain the Empire without it, to confirm their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; ſo that from thenceforth they enjoyed their Territories as <hi>Fees,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to depend on the Emperor, and ſwore Allegiance to him and the Empire, From hence it is, that by what means ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Princes got their Eſtates, they now hold them as <hi>Fees</hi> of the Empire<hi>:</hi> Yet the name of <hi>Vaſſal</hi> has not deprived theſe Princes of any <hi>conſiderable part</hi> of their Power and Grandeur; for, if I grant a man any part of my Eſtate, to be holden of me as a <hi>Fee,</hi> though I put him thereby into a full poſſeſſion, yet I make him my Subject, and I, as the Lord of the <hi>Fee,</hi> may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what Laws or Conditions I pleaſe to the poſſeſſion of what I thus grant: But then, he who conſenteth to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what he already hath, to be a <hi>Fee</hi> holden of the Party thus conſented to, is ſuppoſed only to own the Lord of the <hi>Fee</hi> as a ſuperiour Confederate in an unequal League, and ſo to reſpect his Majeſty and reverence his Dignity.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54100:37"/>
caſt away their Dominions, or to ſubmit them to the Abſolute Dominion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but rather to ſeek a ſtrong Protector or Defender of their Rights. Thus the State of theſe Princes being once introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and confirmed, it was fit that thoſe who were afterwards exalted to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the Emperors, in the ſtead of any Families that happened to be extinguiſhed, ſhould alſo be advanced to the ſame ſtate of Freedom and Power with the ancient Princes. And in the mean time, thoſe that are well verſed in Civil Prudence, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, will eaſily acknowledge, that this <hi>Feudal</hi> Obligation of the Princes to the Emperor, only made them unequal Allies or Confederates, and not Subjects, properly ſo called; for it is inconſiſtent with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Notion of a Subject to exerciſe a <note place="margin">

But then, to force an Ally by the reſt of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who offends againſt the Rules of the League, is very uſual in all ſuch caſes, and there are many Examples of it both in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Story.

                  <q>That when they had Emperors of great Wealth, or very much Reverence, on the Score of their eminent Virtues, the Princes were moſt obſequiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly ſubject to them; but when they have had weak or unactive Emperors, they have had only a precarious Command over them.</q> And thoſe Emperors again who have endeavour'd to pluck up this ſo deeply rooted Power of the Princes, and to reduce <hi>Germany</hi> into the condition of a true Monarchy or Kingdom, have ſometimes pull'd Ruin down upon themſelves, and have ever failed of their hopes, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing by it, but the diſquieting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. Nor have thoſe that endeavoured to do it by Craft made any progreſs, becauſe ſome or other have found out the Deſign, and diſappointed it; and if any thing were gained from the Princes at any time one way, it was loſt another.

               <p n="6">6. I muſt in the next place ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">The election of the Biſhops.</note> of the Biſhops too. Now it is certain, that in the firſt times of Chriſtianity the Biſhops were elected and conſtituted by the Clergy and the Faithful People; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, about the IV. Century, when Princes embraced the Chriſtian Religion, a Cuſtom was taken up by them of not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any perſon to be made a Biſhop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Conſent, becauſe they very well underſtood, that it tended very much to the preſervation of the publick Peace, to have good and peaceable men in that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Office. The Kings of the <hi>Franks</hi> took up the ſame Cuſtom, and would ſuffer none to be made Biſhops in their Kingdom, but ſuch as they approved of. And the Emperors of <hi>Germany</hi> continued the ſame Right till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth<hi>: Gregory</hi> the Seventh began a Quarrel againſt this Prince on that Score, which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by his Succeſſors, againſt the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Emperors; till at length his Son <hi>Henry</hi> V. weary of the Broils this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie had occaſion'd, in the <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Worms,</hi> in the year 1122, renounced this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54100:39"/>
Imperial Priviledge of conſtituting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting the Biſhops; but yet the Emperor <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Renounced by the</hi> Emperor.</note> had ſtill the Right of delivering to the elected Biſhop the <hi>Regalia</hi> and <hi>Fees,</hi> by the delivery of a <hi>Croſier.</hi> Now it is not eaſie to conceive what the Emperor loſt by the yielding this great point; for though his power before over the Secular Princes was not great, yet as long as the Church was ſubject to him, he could eaſily equal, or, if need was, overrule their Forces. In the Agreement between the Pope and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, the Election of the Biſhops was ſetled in the Clergy and People jointly, yet afterwards the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Cathedral</hi> Churches began to claim the ſole power of chuſing them, the Pope conniving at this their Uſurpation, it being more for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to have this Affair in a few hands, than in many. At length things came to this: That the Confirmation of the new ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Biſhop was to be ſought from <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas this, as well as the Conſecration before, belonged to the <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> But then, the Examples of Men, provided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with Biſhopricks, by the power of the Pope, was very rare in <hi>Germany,</hi> and I ſuppoſe the reaſon was, becauſe the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would ſcarce have ſubmitted patiently to a Biſhop, ſo obtruded on them (though it was practis'd frequently in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.)</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Biſhops of <hi>Germany</hi> are indebted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Biſhopricks of</hi> Germany <hi>endowed by the Emperors.</hi>
                  </note> to the Liberality of the firſt Emperors, for all thoſe Provinces and great Revenues
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54100:39"/>
they now enjoy; a fervent Piety and Zeal in thoſe times ruling in the minds of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe they thought the more they gave to the Church, the more they united themſelves to God. Which Opinion is much abated in our times, becauſe many now (how truly I know not) have taken up another, contrary to it, <hi>viz That over great Wealth, beſtowed on Church men, tends rather to the extinguiſhing than nouriſhing of Piety and Religion.</hi> The Church-men alſo of thoſe early times ſeem to have had the Grace of asking, without fear, whatever might ſeem convenient for the allaying the Hardſhips of their Profeſſion. Thus the Biſhops and Churches obtained of theſe good Princes not only <hi>Farms, Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Rents,</hi> but alſo whole <hi>Lordſhips, Counties, Dukedoms,</hi> with all the <hi>Regalia</hi>'s or Royalties annexed to them, ſo that they became equal in all things to the Temporal Princes. But then, in truth, they obtained the Degree of Princes but in the times of the <hi>Otho</hi>'s, and thoſe that followed; and they got not the <hi>Regalia</hi> all at once, but by little and little, ſome at one time, and ſome at another: And from thence it comes, that ſome of the Biſhops have not yet got them all, and others have them under the reſtraint of certain Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There were two other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed very much to the accuring all theſe great Riches and Honours for the Church. 1. That many of the Nobility in thoſe times took Orders, and became Church-men; and, 2. That all the little
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54100:40"/>
Learning thoſe barbarous Ages had, was in the Clergy. This occaſion'd the calling the Biſhops to Court, to give their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the employing them as Judges and Governours in the Provinces, becauſe theſe things cannot be well perform'd without ſome Learning. And this was the true reaſon why the Office of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor was at firſt annexed to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Biſhops <hi>Sees.</hi> I do alſo believe, that the Riches of the Church were very much improved by many Princes and Noblemen, who reſigned their Eſtates, or a part of them, to the Biſhops, and took them again as <hi>Fees</hi> from them, that they might ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to take the more care in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending them, and their Salvation, to God in their Prayers, and as their Families after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were extinguiſhed, their Eſtates were united to the Biſhopricks. Who knows not alſo what vaſt Additions have been ſince made by the Wills of Dying Men, when a Nation that is naturally afraid of Heat and Thirſt, ſaw they muſt buy off the Roaſting in Purgatory, by that means which they feared above all men?</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Church-men might have been <note place="margin">When they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very rich, they would not be ſubject to their Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</note> well contented with their Condition in <hi>Germany,</hi> though they had neither abjured Ambition nor Avarice<hi>:</hi> But then, as they of all men are deſirous to have others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, ſo they could leaſt endure to ſee others above them, and therefore thought this was ſtill wanting to perfect their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this World, becauſe they were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54100:40"/>
ſtill forced to receive all they had from the Emperor, and conſequently were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to live in a dependence on him. If the Reverence I owe that moſt Sacred Order of Men, did not reſtrain me, I ſhould ſay, they were the worſt of men, who, as the event ſhews, abuſed the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Liberality of the Emperors, to the Ruin of that Majeſty and Power that had raiſed and enriched, dignified and ennobled them. Certainly, he is not worthy of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, who is not willing to own his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numiſſor for his Patron and Maſter. That therefore this Tribe of <hi>Levites</hi> might whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free themſelves from the Subjection of the <hi>Laicks,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Biſhops ſtrenuouſly ſolicited the Pope to ſend abroad his <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Thunders, and raiſed plenty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in the Empire, to ſecond them, by both which they at laſt gained their Point: For the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> led the way, and the reſt of the Flock follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him faithfully, and would never ſuffer their Prince to have any reſt, till he would permit them to depend on no body but the Pope. This, as many think, brought a ſignal Miſchief on the <hi>German</hi> State, <hi>viz.</hi> The having ſo many of its Members ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Foreign Head, unleſs we can think the Pope was ſo fondly in love with <hi>Germany,</hi> that he deſired nothing more than its Preſervation, and that they at <hi>Rome</hi> knew better what was for the Good of <hi>Germany,</hi> than the very <hi>Germans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did.</p>

                  </note> Times they had no Cities, was firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the old <hi>Germans</hi> had no skill in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture; which Ignorance ſtill appears in many places of this Country; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The <hi>Fierceneſs</hi> of the Nation, which made them averſe to theſe kinds of Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as a fort of Priſons; and alſo, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Becauſe the Nobility placed their greateſt Pleaſure in Hunting, and therefore neither knew nor much valued the Conveniencies of having Cities and great Towns. Their Dyet then was very mean, their Furniture and Clothes cheap, and they neither knew nor regarded the Superfluous Effects of Wealth or Luxury; but after their Minds were civiliz'd and ſoftned by Chriſtianity, they began, by degrees, to affect the elegant way of living; the love of Riches, and a ſtudied Luxury followed, and was brought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54100:41"/>
in from abroad, both which are nouriſhed by great Cities<hi>:</hi> The Princes alſo having amaſs'd great Riches, took a Pride in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cities, and invited the Ruſticks of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Inhabitants of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſettle in them, by the Grant of large Priviledges, eſpecially after the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion had aboliſhed <hi>Villenage</hi> or <hi>Slavery,</hi> and the <hi>Liberti</hi> or Freemen had no Lands to ſubſiſt on, they flew by Flocks to the Cities, and betook themſelves to Manufactures and Trading. The Irru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> forced <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Falconer</hi> to build many Cities and ſtrong Holds in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and he made every ninth man be drawn out of the Country to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit them: The Leagues afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cities, for their mutual Defence and Trade, gave them great Security, and by conſequence made them populous and rich. The principal of theſe Leagues is that made by the Cities on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the year 1255, in which ſome Princes deſired to be included: The <hi>Hanſe</hi> League was chiefly made on the account of <hi>Maritime Commerce,</hi> and grew to that height of Power, that they became terrible to the Kings of <hi>Sweden, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> But then, after the year 1500. it became contemptible, becauſe the leſſer Cities, when they found the greater got all the profit, fell generally off, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted them. And the Nations upon the Ocean and <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, by their example, began, about the ſame time alſo, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Trade in their own Subjects, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

the <hi>(Engliſh) Flandrians.</hi> and <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Thus their <hi>Monopoly</hi> failing, their Strength fell with it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Though in the beginning the Cities <note place="margin">

After this, by the enormous and imprudent Liberality of the Emperors, many of the Cities were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> others to the <hi>Dukes</hi> and <hi>Counts,</hi> and the reſt remained as before) only ſubject to the Emperor. In the XII, Century they began to take more liberty. as they found they could relie upon their Riches, becauſe the Emperors, by reaſon of the Inteſtin Wars, were not able then to reduce them to a due Obedience; ſome Princes were but juſt advanced to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Dignity, and ſo were forced alſo to purchaſe the Favour and Aſſiſtance of the great Cities, by the Grants of new Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Immunities, that they might employ them as a Bulwark againſt their Refractory Biſhops and Princes; after this, by degrees they ſhaked off the Emperor's Advocates.

their Freedom all at once, but one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, as they could gain the Favour of the Emperor; and that is one Reaſon that they have not all the ſame Priviledges, and ſome of them want a part of the <hi>Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> to this day. Some of them bought theſe Priviledges of their Dukes or Biſhops, and others ſhook them off by force, and then entred into Treaties for the purging that Iniquity; for when theſe Princes were poor or low, their laſt Remedy was, to ſell the richeſt of their Subjects their Liberty; and others, when they ſaw they could no longer keep them in ſubjection, took what they could get from them, and were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly contented with it.</p>

               <p>1. THough <hi>Germany</hi> conſiſteth of ſo many <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Emperor the Head of</hi> Germany.</note> Members, many of which are great and perfect States, yet it has at all times (excepting the <hi>Interregnums</hi> which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened) ſince <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, been united to one Head (which the Ancients only call'd their King, the later Ages by the more ambitions Titles of the <hi>Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> and <hi>Caſar)</hi> and upon the ſole account of this Head, it has ſeem'd, to the moſt of men, to be one ſingle ſimple State: And my next buſineſs is, to ſhew how this Head is conſtituted or appointed; but then it will be worth my while, by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, to repreſent this Affair from its Riſe, that it may the more clearly appear how much the preſent differeth from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Election, and what is the true Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the <hi>Electoral Princes.</hi> As to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and his Poſterity, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire and the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> are to be ſeverally and diſtinctly conſidered: The <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Empire of the</hi> Romans <hi>pretendedly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Pope.</hi>
                  </note> firſt of theſe was collated upon <hi>Charles,</hi> by the Pope and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54100:43"/>
principal Members of that Empire, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as upon one who plainly deſigned to make himſelf Emperor, and that as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in an Hereditary way<hi>:</hi> So that the Crowning his Succeſſors had not the force of a new and free Election, but of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Inaguration: For we read, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great made <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son, and <hi>Lewis</hi> made alſo <hi>Lotharius</hi> his Son their Conſorts in the Empire, and yet there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of their asking the Conſent of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe occaſions. But then, as to the ancient Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> we cannot affirm, that it was either meerly elective, or meerly hereditary, but a mixture of both: For we read frequently, that the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Kingdom of</hi> France <hi>morchereditary than elective.</hi>
                  </note> Kings of <hi>France</hi> were conſtituted by the Conſent and Approbation of the Nobility and whole People of <hi>France,</hi> but in ſuch a manner yet, that they never choſe out of the Line of the dead King, but for very great reaſons; which kind of Election is (as we know) ſtill obſerved in <hi>Poland;</hi> yet he that ſhall curiouſly obſerve it, ſhall find, <hi>France</hi> had more of a Succeſſive than of an Elective Kingdom; <hi>So that it ſeems to have been collated on the firſt of the Race, with a Condition, that he ſhould tranſmit it to his Poſterity, unleſs they appeared to the People very unworthy of it.</hi> So that the Children of the Deceaſed King did not ſo much gain a new Right to the Kingdom by this Approbation of the Nobility and People, as a Declaration, that they were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54100:44"/>
of ſucceeding, by the Right that was at firſt collated on them: Afterwards the Line of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or rejected, and denied the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Germany,</hi> or, as they then called it, the <hi>Eaſt Kingdom of France,</hi> was, by the moſt free Conſent of <note place="margin">Germany <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven freely to</hi> Otho, <hi>and after to</hi> Conrad.</note> the Nobility, given to <hi>Otho</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> who excuſing himſelf on the account of his Age, by his Advice <hi>Conrad</hi> Duke of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> was by them choſen King of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who was, as ſome think, of the Line of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. By his Counſel alſo afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Falconer,</hi> Son of <hi>Otho</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> was by a free Election advanced to that Kingdom, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with <hi>Germany,</hi> would not accept the Title of <hi>Emperor,</hi> though the Pope offered it to him; but <hi>Otho</hi> the Great his Son, having ſubdued <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo united <hi>Rome,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Empire of</hi> Rome <hi>united to the Kingdom of</hi> Germany <hi>for ever.</hi>
                  </note> the Lands of the Church to <hi>Germany,</hi> that from thenceforward he that had the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Germany</hi> without any new Election, ſhould be Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Pope being nothing but a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, though before this Ceremony the Kings of <hi>Germany</hi> had not uſually uſed the Title of <hi>Emperors.</hi> The ſame form of Succeſſion hereupon was uſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> which had been obſerved in the old King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France, viz.</hi> That the Conſent of the Nobility and People did not eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Order of a Lineal Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Royal Family: And this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who being young, and

perhaps not Governing well, the Nobility thereupon, by the procurement of the <hi>Pope,</hi> roſe up againſt him, and depoſed him from the Kingdom, and, for the time to come, made a Law, <hi>That though the Son of the laſt King were worthy to ſucceed him, yet he ſhould attain the Throne by a Free Election, and not by a Lineal Succeſſion;</hi> as the words of that Conſtitution run.</p>
               <p>2. That old Approbation and Election <note place="margin">The ancient Elections not made by any certain num<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

And Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> V. inſtituted the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 7 <hi>Electors not inſtituted by</hi> Otho <hi>III.</hi>
                  </note> Seven Electors, but with this Difference, that ſome Authors aſcribe the principal ſhare in the Act to the Emperor, and others to the Pope, as each man was affected to them. Our Countryman <hi>Onuphrius Panvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54100:45"/>
was the firſt man that oppoſed this Opinion in a Book, <hi>De Comitiis imperatoriis, of the Imperial Diets,</hi> which is ſince approved by all the wiſeſt of the <hi>German</hi> Nation. His beſt Argument againſt it, is, Becauſe this <hi>Ottonian</hi> or <hi>Gregorian</hi> Conſtitution was never yet produced by any man, and no man has mentioned it from the times of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. to thoſe of <hi>Otho</hi> III, which contains 240 years; for the firſt that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Electors was one <hi>Martin</hi> a <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> who lived under this <hi>Frederick,</hi> and therefore his Teſtimony was juſtly liable to exception, ſeeing it was not ſupported by any better in an Affair which happened ſo long before his own times: And yet, after all, he doth not mention any ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; nor doth he ſay, the Electors began in the time of that <hi>Otho,</hi> but that, after his times, the <hi>Officers of the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to elect:</hi> Which is capable of a double ſence, either becauſe they were then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of very large Dominions, who before had the principal Offices in the Court; or becauſe thoſe Offices were then firſt collated for ever on Princes that had very great Dominions, who, though perhaps they had a Signal Authority, as the moſt eminent men above all others; yet that the Election belonged to other Princes beſides theſe Seven, can be denied by no man who is not very ignorant of the <hi>German</hi> Antiquities. Others have aſcribed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Seven Electors to <hi>Frederick</hi> II, but then there is no Record of any Law
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54100:45"/>
to that purpoſe any where to be found; nor is it probable, that the reſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo early and ſo eaſily parted with their Right of Electing.</p>
               <p>3. The current Opinion of the moſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>But yet they ſeem ancienter than</hi> Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick <hi>II.</hi>
                  </note> Skilful in the <hi>German</hi> Affairs, is, That before the times of <hi>Frederick</hi> II, thoſe Seven Princes, as the great Officers of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and perſons that had great Eſtates, began by degrees to overtop the reſt, and to have the greateſt Authority in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Emperors; but after the times of this <hi>Frederick,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Affairs being wonderfully diſordered, whilſt the reſt took little or no care of the Publick, theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven aſſumed it wholly to themſelves. This, after it was confirm'd into a Cuſtom by ſome repeated Acts, was at laſt paſſed into a Law by the ſolemn and publick Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Golden Bull, in which the whole form of the Election, and all the Power of the Electors, is contained; and from thenceforward thoſe Princes added to their former Titles that of <hi>Electors,</hi> and were ever after eſteemed as perſons ſet in an higher Station and Dignity than the reſt.</p>
               <p>5. Thus, though at the firſt theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">Of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Electors.</note> ſeem to have aſſumed the power of electing the Emperor, as they were the great <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Empire;</hi> yet afterwards, by the Law call'd the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> thoſe very Offices, as well as the <hi>Electoral Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> are annexed to certain Dominions; ſo that whoever is legally poſſeſſed of them,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54100:46"/>
is thereby made one of the Electors; the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Electors</hi> in the mean time are made by Election or Collation, as the other Biſhops of <hi>Germany</hi> are; where it is to be obſerved, that though theſe Biſhops, to enable them to perform the other Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to their Office, ſtand in need of the Pope's Confirmation, and the Pall, which they muſt not expect <hi>gratis;</hi> yet they are admitted without them to the Election of the Emperor, becauſe theſe Secular Dignities paſs without the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter: But then, when the See is vacant, the <hi>Chapter</hi> has no Right to meddle with the Election: In the Secular or Temporal Electors the Succeſſion paſſeth in a lineal Paternal Deſcent, ſo that neither the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Dignity, nor the Lands united to it, admit of any Diviſion: But if a new Elector is to be made, or for ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence any one is to be deprived of that Dignity, it is, without doubt, agreeable to the other Laws and Cuſtoms of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for the Emperor not to diſpoſe of the ſaid Dignity, without the Conſent of the other States, or, at leaſt, not without that of the Electors; though it is not to be denied, the laſt Age ſaw an Example to the contrary, againſt which however one or two of the Electors proteſted, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror deſpiſing their words, becauſe he ſaw his Arms proſper; yet this Prince had wit enough to beſtow the Dignity on one of the ſame Line and Family, which tended very much to the abating the Envy of the Fact,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54100:46"/>
and divided two moſt potent Families, by raiſing an endleſs Emulation between them, and made that Party that was obliged by the Grant, obnoxious to the Imperial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily for the preſervation of it. If any of the Electors happen to be a Minor, their Guardians ſupply their place, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority ceaſeth when the Prince is Eighteen years of age.</p>
               <p>6. The manner of the Election is thus: The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Mentz,</hi> within one Month <note place="margin">Of the manner of the Election.</note> after he knows of the Death of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, ſignifies it to his <hi>Colleagues,</hi> and calls them to the Election that is to be made, who meet in perſon, or by their Proxies: When they enter <hi>Frankford,</hi> each of them is allowed Two hundred Horſemen, and no more; but this thing at this day is not nicely obſerved. Whilſt the Election is making, all Strangers are commanded to depart. They begin the Election in the Chancel of the Church of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> with the Ceremony of the Maſs, then they come to the Altar, and each of them ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that he will chuſe a fit perſon to be Emperor. The Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> as Dean of the College, gathereth their <hi>Votes,</hi> and firſt he asketh the Biſhop of <hi>Trier,</hi> then the Biſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and ſo all the reſt in their order, and gives his own in the laſt place. The majority of Votes is as good as the whole; but then, whereas there is now eight, it was never yet certainly agreed what ſhould be done, in caſe the Votes ſhould happen to be equally divided. None
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54100:47"/>
of the Electors is excluded from the Right of nominating himſelf. When the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made, it is recorded in Writing, and confirmed with the Seals of the Electors; then they all together go to the Altar, and the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> aſſembles the People, and declareth to them the Name of the new elected Emperor, out of the Writing: After this, the Empire is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him upon certain Conditions, but ſo, that he is forthwith bound to confirm to all and every one of the Electors, all their Rights and Priviledges. By the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bull, Aix la Chappelle</hi> is appointed for the City where he is to be Crowned, though for the moſt part, ever ſince, the Coronation is perform'd in the ſame place where the Election is made, and becauſe that City is in the Dioceſs of <hi>Cologne,</hi> that Ceremony has been commonly performed by the Elector of <hi>Cologne;</hi> yet the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> alwaies puts in his Claim for it, and, if I be not deceived, of late this Controverſie is thus determin'd; That they ſhall do it by Turns, whereever the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is Crowned. The reſt of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies may be eaſily found in <hi>German</hi> Writers.</p>
               <p>7. Perhaps it would be too hard, and <note place="margin">The Electors have depoſed an Emperor.</note> too invidious, to make a Publick and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Law, to declare, That the <hi>Electors</hi> have a full Right and Power to depoſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, if he deſerves it, as well as to elect him: Yet it is certain, they exerciſed this <hi>Power</hi> upon <hi>Wenceſlaus, Sigiſmond,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:54100:47"/>
the Fourth being elected in his ſtead, in the year 1411. This Prince, that he might gain the Empire, made the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> and rewarded the Electors with great Gifts, which is very much reſented by thoſe who are not well affected to the Electors. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was depoſed by the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces joined with the Electors: And in truth the Biſhops of <hi>Mentz</hi> have pretty plainly and fearleſly ſung this Tune, and claimed the Right of depoſing the Emperors, to one or two of them, who were engaged in Deſigns that were not acceptable to theſe Prelates.</p>
               <p>8. The Electors have ſome other Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The Electors have ſome other ſpecial Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> Rights, beyond what belongs to any of the other Princes; for they are not only the greateſt Officers of the Empire, but they have Right alſo, in ſome Caſes, to exclude all the reſt of the States and Princes, and to conſult amongſt themſelves about things of the greateſt importance. The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> is Lord Chancellor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> The Archbiſhop of <hi>Trier</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Kingdom of <hi>Arles</hi> (by which Names the moſt skilful do not underſtand all that Country that is now call'd <hi>France,</hi> but only ſo much of it as in the XI. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury belonged to the Kingdom of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and was then united to <hi>Germany.)</hi> And the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> is Chancellor of <hi>Italy:</hi> But then, at this day, the firſt of theſe has an effectual Power, and the other two have nothing but meer empty Titles. The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is Lord <hi>Cup. bearer,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:54100:48"/>
and in the higheſt Ceremonies and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, gives the Emperor the firſt Cup of Wine. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> is now Lord <hi>High Sewer,</hi> and carrieth the <hi>Pome</hi> or <hi>Globe</hi> before the Emperor in the Solemn Proceſſions. The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> is Lord <hi>High Marſhal,</hi> and carrieth the naked Sword before the Emperor. The Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> is Lord <hi>High Chamberlain,</hi> and gives the Emperor Water to waſh, and in the Solemn Proceſſion carrieth the Scepter. The Count <hi>Palatine of the Rhine</hi> is Lord <hi>High Treaſurer,</hi> and in the Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Palace, at the Coronation, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the Gold and Silver Medals amongſt the People. Each of the Secular Electors has his certain known Deputy for the performance of his Function; <hi>Limburg</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Cup for the King of <hi>Bohemia; Walburg</hi> is Sewer for <hi>Bavaria; Papenheim</hi> carrieth the Sword for <hi>Saxony;</hi> the Counts of <hi>Hoenzolleren</hi> is Deputy for <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> and <hi>Sintzendorf</hi> for the Count <hi>Palatine of the Rhine.</hi> There are alſo other Priviledges belonging to the Electors, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> as peculiar to them, but are at this day poſſeſs'd by other Princes too, two only excepted, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That there lies no Appeal from their Judgment; and, 2. That in the regranting their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Fees, they are above controul; and as to the taking up their own, they do it without any Charge: And perhaps there may be ſome others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:54100:48"/>
9. When there is an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> or <note place="margin">What is done during the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum.</note> want of an Emperor, the Count <hi>Palatine of the Rhine,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that Defect, and Govern as Viceroys; the firſt, all the Countries on the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Schwaben,</hi> and whereever the <hi>Franconian</hi> Laws and Cuſtoms take place: The ſecond takes Care of all the Countries which are under <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws; but then neither of them are allowed to diſpoſe of the Fees of the Empire, which ſhall become vacant by the Death of any Prince, which are given by the delivery of a Banner. Nor can they alienate or mortgage any of the Demeans of the Empire; all the reſt of their Acts are for the moſt part confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the new elected Emperor. In the laſt Vacancy, upon the Death of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> III. the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> diſputed the Count <hi>Palatine</hi>'s <hi>Viceroyalty;</hi> to gain his Point, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> uſed great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, that he might not be diſappointed in his deſign: He laid Poſt-Horſes and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers on the Road, who gave him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Death of the Emperor very early, and upon that he preſently ſent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to acquaint the Princes and States with it, and that he had taken upon him the Care of the Empire in the <hi>Franconian</hi> Circles; whereupon many of the Princes and States being ſurprized by this ſubtile Management, congratulated his Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Death of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was known to the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> whoſe Right it was. But however, that Count did not patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54100:49"/>
ſuffer his Right to be thus ſliely ſtoln from him, but declared for the future he claimed this his <hi>Vicarian Power,</hi> and entered a Complaint againſt the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> for thus uſurping his Right: And it is very certain, the far greateſt part of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces repented they had conſented to this Attempt of the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> but could not then recall their Letters to him: But then, as is uſual in ſuch Encroachments, no man was willing to join with the Oppreſſed, and make his Quarrel his own, afterwards they printed Books one againſt the other. Now, though no man could wonder that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſhould venture upon this Practice, who in the more flouriſhing ſtate of the Count <hi>Palatin</hi>'s Affairs, had pretended to the <hi>Electorate,</hi> and now having got part of the <hi>Palatin</hi>'s Country, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his own Power, and was otherwiſe well aſſured of the Concurrence and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> both on the account of Kindred and Religion; yet the far greateſt part of the indifferent Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors thought the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhewn his Right, and demonſtrated that this <hi>Vicarian</hi> Viceroyalty was no part of the Great <hi>Lord High Sewer</hi>'s Offices, but was perpetually annexed to the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> has the other half of that Power in the reſt of <hi>Germany,</hi> not as <hi>Elector,</hi> but as <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Saxony:</hi> But then, as there were many that openly favoured the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> ſo the reſt were not willing openly to eſpouſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54100:49"/>
the oppoſite ſide, and that Prince would not confeſs he had done wrong, and ſo the Controverſie remains undetermin'd ſtill.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Have already ſhewn by what degrees <note place="margin">Of the Limits ſet to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Power.</note> and upon what occaſions the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Germany</hi> mounted themſelves to that exceſſive height of Power and Wealth, as is wholly inconſiſtent with the Laws of a regular Monarchy. Nor is it worth our wonder, that when the Election of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in aftertimes was devolved upon them, they ſet their Hearts upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what they had gotten. By this Change in the State of Affairs the Kings (of <hi>Germany)</hi> loſt the Power of Diſpoſing or Governing as they thought fit, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of that Nation, and were neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to conſult the Princes in things of great moment, and tranſact more of their buſineſs with the States by their Authority, than by their Soveraign Power; and there is no queſtion to be made, but the Princes inſerted a Clauſe to this purpoſe very early into the Coronation Oath of <hi>Germany,</hi> (which is uſually adminiſtred to all Chriſtian Princes, in a very ſolemn manner, upon their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54100:50"/>
Acceſſion to any Crown) <hi>viz. That the King ſhould Promiſe and Swear to Defend all the Rights of all and ſingular the Inhabitants of</hi> Germany, <hi>and obſerve and keep all the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cuſtoms in that Kingdom received and uſed.</hi> But whether in proceſs of time any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Laws were added to the old, and comprehended in Writing, is not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, becauſe before the times of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, we have no Copies of any ſuch Capitulations or Agreements; and thoſe that are pretended to be more ancient, are of no great certainty. And whereas it is ſaid in the <hi>Golden Bull, The Emperor ſhall preſently confirm all the Rights, Priviledges, and Immunities of the</hi> Electoral Princes, <hi>by his Patent under Seal.</hi> This ſeems to belong only to them, and therefore is a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing from the Agreement by which the Emperor is now obliged to engage for the Liberty or Freedom of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Now, the Reaſons why the Electors deſired to have <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth bound to them, in ſo many expreſs and tedious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Covenants, was, That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great Power of that Prince, his Youth, High Spirit, (teſtified by his Motto <hi>Plus ultra)</hi> and his other Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, feared leſt he ſhould imploy his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Eſtates to ſubdue the <hi>German</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and took this way, to make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>That he muſt Govern</hi> Germany <hi>after another manner than he did his other Dominions.</hi> And this Cuſtom being once taken up, has
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54100:51"/>
been ever ſince continued, though there are not the ſame Reaſons there were at firſt for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Conditions have been preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note place="margin">Theſe Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons preſcribed only by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</note> to the Emperors by the Electors, without conſulting the other States of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> though they have ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it, and in the laſt Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> it was moved, <hi>That in the next Diet there might be care taken to draw up a ſtanding form of Articles, which ſhould be perpetual.</hi> And I heard, when I was at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> that it was then under ſerious Debate, and that much Paper had been ſpent in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but the Wiſer part thought the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> had no reaſon to fear the event of this Conſultation, becauſe it was the Emperors Intereſt, as well as theirs, that the <hi>Electors</hi> ſhould ſtill be in a better condition than the other Princes; for they being few in number, might more eaſily be brought to a compliance with him, than the other States, which were more numerous, and therefore it was reaſonable on the other ſide, that he ſhould rather indulge them of the two. And thoſe Princes of the Empire who were deſcended of the Electoral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies were very inclinable to it too, and the Demands of the reſt might be deluded, without much difficulty. Nor doth it agree with the Manners of <hi>Germany,</hi> to deprive any man of what he has by Force and Combination, however he came by it. They added, That though what the States
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54100:51"/>
asked was not unreaſonable, <hi>viz.</hi> That they might be equally ſecured in the Capitular with the Electors; yet that it was not poſſible to pen an Inſtrument in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that upon the change of times and things, it would be neceſſary to change and correct it. That in the former Agreements there were many things changed, added, and altered, as the neceſſity of the times required, and as they found the Chinks and ſtarting Holes their Emperors had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to eſcape out at. That the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors would willingly, at the requeſt of the Diet, inſert whatever was neceſſary for the preſervation of the Liberty of <hi>Germany;</hi> but then it was abſurd, to think the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors would not preferr their own proper Intereſt to that of all other men: Nor could they diveſt themſelves of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Inclinations of Mankind. Some others ſuſpect there was another reaſon at this time, which brought the buſineſs of the Capitulars upon the Stage. The Emperor, who hated the thoughts of a Diet, was then neceſſitated to call one, by a <hi>Turkiſh War,</hi> which then threatned his Dominions; and this Affair was then ſet on foot, to the end he might by this means obtain plentiful Contributions from the States of <hi>Germany;</hi> but then they offered Souldiers inſtead of Money; and this not anſwering the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Emperor's Miniſters, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon clapt up a Peace with the Turks much ſooner than they otherwiſe intended, and then were doubtful what <note n="*" place="margin">

To anſwer this, they put them upon an inextricable buſineſs, that they might at their return be able, if need were, to ſwear they had not been wholly idle; and that repeating all their vain uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Brangles about the Capitular, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it over to the next Diet, as a thing which could not now be determin'd, they might make this Story ſerve for a <hi>Receſs,</hi> or parting Edict, ſuch as it was.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatever was the true cauſe of that <note place="margin">

                  </note> Debate, it cannot be denied, but that the introducing the Cuſtom of Comprehending the Laws the Emperor was to govern them by, in expreſs Articles in Writing, was a thing of great good uſe; for this tended altogether to the Reputation and Honour of the States, that ſeeing they would not he governed in the ſame manner as the Subjects of other Monarchs are, their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties which they enjoyed might not ſeem meer Contumacy or Uſurpation, but the effects of a Contract made with their Prince when they choſe him to be their Emperor.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54100:52"/>
They conſulted hereby alſo the Safety of their Liberties, the Emperor being limited in ſuch Bounds, as he ought not in any caſe to paſs over, and being deprived of all reaſonable cauſe of Complaint, that he was not as Abſolute as the reſt of his Neighbour-Monarchs whoſe Subjects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves, on all occaſions, to be their moſt Dutiful and Obedient Subjects. The <hi>Germans</hi> on the other ſide, in the introduction of their <hi>Capitular,</hi> ſay, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe terms the Emperor has undertaken the Government of the Empire, and has yielded, by way of</hi> Compact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>the ſaid terms to the</hi> Electors, <hi>in the behalf of themſelves and the other States of</hi> Germany. Now, if he had diſliked theſe Conditions, he ought to have refuſed that Dignity, or to have ſhewn the Electors beforehand, that there was ſomething of Injuſtice or Abſurdity in them, and they, without doubt, would in that caſe have corrected them. But then, when the Emperor has accepted a Limited Power, it is utterly unreaſonable he ſhould endeavour to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a full and Regal Authority over them; or, at leaſt, it will appear much the more reaſonable for them to oppoſe him in it; for there are none of the more underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Germans,</hi> who do not believe the Regal Power may be included in certain Limits. And I ſuppoſe, the more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Politicians will not deny, that there may be ſuch a Competent Power aſſigned to the Head of a Confederate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54100:53"/>
it is not enough to ſhew, that he has no Superiour, but he muſt alſo ſhew, that all the reſt of his Subjects are bound, without diſpute, to obey all his Commands, and have no Right to appeal from him, much leſs will it be ſufficient to ſhew, that he is the Higheſt in that State. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: In our Common-wealth of <hi>Venice;</hi> as if the Duke were not the Higheſt; and yet no man dares aſcribe the Soveraign Power to him: For, as in all Common-wealths, whether they be <hi>Ariſtocracies</hi> or <hi>Democracies,</hi> there may be Princes properly ſo called, who may be rightly ſtiled the Higheſt in their Commonwealths and yet ſtill not be Kings. So alſo in all <hi>Syſtems</hi> of co ordinate States, which are Confederates each to other, there may be ſome one more eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom the particular Care of the whole is committed, and ſo he may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called the Higheſt, or the Head of that Body, though he has in truth no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority over the Confederates, nor can or ought to treat them as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But I think it were better here for the preſent to conſider diſtinctly what part of the Soveraign Powers are intruſted to the Emperor; for if a man doth not know them, he is utterly unqualified to judge of the <hi>German</hi> Government. And here it will befit us rather to follow the Order which agrees with the <hi>Genius</hi> of that Empire, than that which is preſcribed by <hi>Politicians,</hi> as more regular and exact.</p>

5. We will therefore begin with the <note place="margin">The Emperor doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or puniſh the Magiſtrates in the Empire.</note> Appointment of <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> which in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Polity is a part of the <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> for if they are at laſt accountable for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management of their Miniſters, it is fit they ſhould have a Right to examin their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and if they have failed in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their Duty, they muſt have Power to remove, or ſome other way to puniſh them. Now there is no queſtion to be made, but the Emperor has this Power in a Soveraign Degree, in his Hereditary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but then, as to the reſt of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it is diſputed; for in the beginning the <hi>Dukes</hi> and <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> were Magiſtrates properly ſo called, as we have above ſhewn, and yet now they have Supreme Authority within their Limits, under thoſe Titles. Nor will any of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> yield the Emperor the Government of the People within their Dominions, or that they are the Subjects of the Emperor, though they will with great Ceremony and much Submiſſion own themſelves to be his moſt dutiful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and teſtifie their great Loyalty to him. And although there may be an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Juriſdiction in a Kingdom which ſhall ſtill be a meer Magiſtracy; yet then the Supreme Authority muſt have reſerved a Soveraign Power over that perſon that is inveſted with it.

Perhaps the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror might be allowed to admit amongſt them a foreign Prince, who is not ſubject to any of them.

It is probable, however, there would be leſs difficulty in receiving foreign Cities into the number of the free Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> 1.

any pretence whatſoever, or to enter into any Alliance with a Foreigner, without at leaſt the Conſent of the Electors.

Now it was certainly here the part of a prudent Judge, to ſhew himſelf equal and indifferent to both the contending Parties, or preſently to have ſilenced both of them, leſt his Commodities (his Indulgences) ſhould become cheap, and ſuſpected by the People: At leaſt, he ought not ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly to have eſpouſed the Quarrel of his

The more indevout ſort of men were not to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted neither by this Affair, to ſuſpect, that the Prieſts were very like Phyſicians and Chirurgeons, who reap too much Benefit from the Diſeaſes and Wounds of Men, to be heartily ſorry for them: So that if it was fooliſh and ſacrilegious to give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the Indulgences, to the damage of the Church, it had been prudent to ſweeten a man of too warm a temper with Preſents, Preferments, and Promiſes, that he might not light the Laity into the way of ſhaking off the Church's Yoke; and when ſo many have by Ambition and Gifts aſpired to the higheſt Dignities in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I think, for my ſhare, it would have been worth the while to have wrapped this Monk in Purple, to prevent his doing her ſo great a miſchief: For when <hi>Martin Luther</hi> ſaw he could have no Juſtice done him at the Pope's Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, he began to court the Grace and good Opinion of the Laity, and ſoon after, he poſitively refuſed to ſubmit to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe he had made the Quarrel his own, by entring into it: And that he might not want a Patron, he began to teach, That the Care of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed

                     <hi>Many of the</hi> German <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſerted the See of</hi> Rome.</note> that a great part of the ancient Rites, and all thoſe Doctrines which ſeem'd ſuperfluous to theſe new Teachers, were laid aſide by a conſiderable part of the <hi>Germans;</hi> and at the ſame time many of the Clergy were deprived of their Church-Lands. Thereupon many Suits were commenc'd in the Chamber of <hi>Spire,</hi> by the Clergy, againſt thoſe that had deprived them of their Poſſeſſions; and that Court was alſo very willing to have reſtored all to the outed Clergy, but then the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (as they are call'd) refuſed in this matter to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Juriſdiction of that Court: <q>For though (ſaid they) the Laws in all Caſes command, that they which have been diſpoſſeſs'd, ſhould be reſtored to what they once had; yet, in this Caſe that was now depending, it was ſit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that a lawful general Council, or ſome other publick Convention, (that is a National Council of <hi>Germany)</hi> ſhould firſt conſider and determin, whether the outed Clergy did profeſs and teach the true Religion; for if this was not firſt well proved, (as they believed it could not) it was in vain, and to no good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for them to expect the enjoyment of thoſe Revenues which had been given by their Anceſtors, for the maintenance of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54100:60"/>
the true Worſhip of God.</q> Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were quickly ſenſible, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Proteſtations alone would not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them, the greateſt part of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant States and Princes joined in a League at <hi>Smalcald,</hi> to repell any Force or Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which might be offered to any of them, becauſe they had embraced the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion: At length it came to a War, which proved very unfortunate to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the <hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſs,</hi> the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal perſons of their Party, were both taken Priſoners, and their Religion ſeem'd to be in a deſperate and hopeleſs condition; but then <hi>Maurice</hi> the next Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> reſtored it to its former Power, by his Arms, and the <hi>R.

Afterwards other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Diſcontent aroſe, and laſt of all, a Fire was kindled in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which in a ſhort time involved all <hi>Germany</hi> in a War: Here Fortune at firſt ſmiled upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and proſpered his Affairs beyond his hopes, ſo that in a ſhort time his Armies ſubdued and brought under the greateſt part of <hi>Germany;</hi> and in the year 1629. he preſumed to publiſh an Edict, That all the Clergy ſhould be put in poſſeſſion of all the Church-Revenues, which had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them by the Laity, ſince the Treaty of <hi>Paſſaw.</hi> The ſecret Deſign of this Edict was, to beſpeak the Aſſiſtance

of the Clergy and Catholick States, and to perſwade them, that all his Deſigns tended to the reſettling that Religion, and not to the oppreſſing the Liberties and Rights of the <hi>German</hi> States and Princes: But then, if they had either ſate ſtill, or helped him to ſubdue the Proteſtants; nay, if they had not hindered the reduction of them, it would have been very eaſie for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (thus fluſh'd with Victory, and arm'd with Power) to have model'd them at his pleaſure. How this Project came to fail, is too well known to be repreſented here: And at laſt, in the Treaty of <hi>Oſnaburg</hi> (or <hi>Oſnabruck)</hi> in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> in the year 1648, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Peace of Religion reſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in</hi> Germ.</note> by the V.

which before ſeem'd to be left free to all the States, was for the future ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, that the Subjects of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes, who were of the <hi>Auguſtane Confeſſion,</hi> and in the year 1624. had the Free Exerciſe of their Religion, were ſtill to retain it. And they that had been in the mean time diſturbed, were to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; thoſe who had not enjoyed their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the ſaid year, ſhould have Liberty of Conſcience, but ſhould only exerciſe their Religion in their own private Families, or the Neighbour places: But if their Lords ſhould command them to be gone, they ſhould have liberty to ſell their Eſtates, or manage them by their Deputies: And the Emperor himſelf, in ſome things, indulged his own Proteſtant Subjects, for the ſakes of the Princes. It was alſo agreed, that if any Prince ſhould hereafter think fit to change his Religion, it ſhould be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to him; and that he might have Prieſts in his Court of his own Opinion, but then, that he ſhould not force his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to his Religion, but ſhould leave that he found in poſſeſſion but ſo, that it might be lawful for his Subjects, if they would take up the Religion profeſſed by their Prince. It is alſo to be noted here, that this Liberty of Religion was ſettled by way of Compact or Agreement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Equals, and the Emperor himſelf is one of the Parties; ſo that neither he nor any other of the Catholick States, though they ſhould happen to be the more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

Here the learned <hi>Hermannus Conringius</hi> has led the way in his learned Book, <hi>De Origine Juris Germanici,</hi> whom I ſhall very near wholly follow. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor takes great pains to confute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly-received Opinion, That the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Civil Law</hi> was in the year 1130, by the Command of <hi>Lotharius</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> then Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Germany,</hi> received both in the Schools and Courts of Juſtice: Whereas he ſhews, that to the XIII.

well eſteemed for <hi>Prudence, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the far greateſt part of the People being then not able to write or read. In the XIII.

                     <hi>The forms of the</hi> German <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages.</hi>
                  </note> very differently managed in different times, as is accurately ſet forth by <hi>Conringius</hi> in his Tract <hi>De Germanici Imperii Judiciis,</hi> from whom I ſhall tranſcribe the principal Heads, to ſave my own labour; and I will begin with the Times of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. When any of the Royal Family had any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, either one with another, or with any other, it was determined in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Nobility and People, as were alſo thoſe Caſes of the Nobility, that were of great concernment. The ſmaller Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies the Nobility had, were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the King, or thoſe he ſent, (for ſo they were then called, who are now call'd Commiſſioners, Viſitors, or Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.) For the ending the Conteſts of others, there were ſetled in the Hundreds and Diſtricts certain Judges called <hi>Graves,</hi> who had to aſſiſt them, and ſit with them, others called <hi>Scabins,</hi> choſen out of the Nobility, or the better ſort of the People, and theſe heard and determined all Civil and Criminal Caſes. The <hi>Graves,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the greatneſs of their Hundreds, had certain <hi>Deputies</hi> in every Village, or, as they call them <hi>Sculteſio</hi>'s, (like our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables)</hi> from whom yet there lay an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the <hi>Grave.</hi> The Prieſts alſo puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Vicious Lives of Chriſtian Men by Canonical Cenſures. The Biſhops exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Juriſdiction over the Clergy and the Monks: And the Biſhop was alſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Metropolitan, or a Synod cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54100:65"/>
by him, though afterward Appeals to the Pope began to be made, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Authority of that See; yea, the Caſes of many Laymen were promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly referred to the Biſhops, upon an opinion of their Sanctity and Integrity: But then the Judgment of the Church Revenues was not in the Clergy, but in the <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> or <hi>Vicedames,</hi> which were particularly appointed by the Kings, and ſo the perſons of the Clergy were ſubject to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Clergy, and their Revenues were ſubject to the <hi>Advocates</hi> Judgments, who were Laymen. From theſe fixed ſettled Judges they appealed to the King's Meſſengers, who at certain times travelled over the Provinces (like our itinerant Judges of Aſſize) and from them to the King's Palace, in which Appeals the King himſelf, or the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> gave Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which laſt was alſo appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Cauſes which aroſe in the Court. But then they hardly admitted an Appeal, but where the <hi>Grave</hi> or <hi>Meſſengers</hi> refuſed to adminiſter Juſtice: And all Caſes were determined by a ſhort and very plain Proceſs, and in a few Seſſions or Hearings. So that in all this form there was nothing wanting, but an Appeal for the Clergy to the Pope, who though an holy perſon, was then conſidered as one out of the Bounds of <hi>Germany</hi> (and ſo not to be taken notice of.)</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:54100:65"/>
15. In all theſe things, in proceſs and length of time, almoſt every thing was <note place="margin">The old forms changed in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times.</note> changed. After the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors took cognizance of all the Royal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and the Pope aſſumed to himſelf ſo great Power on that account, that he made no ſcruple to excommunicate the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and declare, that their Subjects were free from the Obligations of their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to them; and he boldly ſaid, the Emperor was his Vaſſal, and the Empire a <hi>Fee</hi> which belonged to his See. As to the Princes Suits or Caſes, this was ever obſerved from the very beginning of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, that they were never determin'd by the Judgment of the King alone, but were alwaies decided in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> of the Nobility, upon a ſimple and ſhort Proceſs, according to Equity and good Conſcience. And even in the firſt Ages of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, if any of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors aſſumed a Power ſingly to iudge of the <hi>Fees</hi> belonging to any of the Princes, the more couragious of them alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt it: Yea, if all the Teſtimonies we have were loſt, the very form of the whole Empire, or its Conſtitution, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove, that things of that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which theſe Suits are of, ought not (by it) to be left to the ſingle Judgment of the Emperor: And therefore they are notoriouſly guilty of palpable Flattery, who pretend, that this Judgment of the Caſes of the Princes of the Empire, which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Das Furſtenrecht,</hi> is a meer
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54100:66"/>
Pretence. But then, it was long after theſe times that theſe inferiour Princes took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to judge arbitrarily of the Caſes of their own Vaſſals, which was done only by ſome Families, and imitated by the Free Imperial Cities, as to their Subjects. The <hi>Germans</hi> call theſe Counts in their Language <hi>Auſtrega's,</hi> and it is probable they began about the times of <hi>Frederick</hi> and the great <hi>Interregnum.</hi> Thoſe that truſted more to their Power or Force than to the Juſtice of their Cauſe, would commit the Trial of it to the Sword. It is alſo a late Practice, which has been taken up by ſome of our later Emperors and Princes, to referr the Caſes depending to their Miniſters and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Lawyers, rather than to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trouble of hearing them. But then this became neceſſary, when inſtead of a few plain Country Cuſtoms, we had introduced the Intricate, Papal, and Civil Laws, which it would have been the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt puniſhment to have put the Princes to the trouble of learning.</p>
               <p n="16">16. As to the <hi>Churchmen,</hi> they innovated <note place="margin">The Innovations brought in by the Churchmen.</note> in theſe particulars: By degrees they drew all the Perſonal Caſes of the Biſhops to the Pope's Tribunal, utterly deſtroying thereby all the Authority of <hi>Metropolitans</hi> and <hi>Synods;</hi> and they took from the Laity all Right of judging in any Caſe a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This is by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> returned to the ancient method, but by the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> ſtill retained, though <hi>Charles</hi> V, and ſome other Princes ſince, have to the great
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54100:66"/>
vexation of the Pope, ordered ſome things pertaining to Religion and puniſhed ſome Clergy-men for great Offences too. In the times alſo of <hi>Frederick</hi> II, and thoſe that followed, the Biſhops and Clergy aſſumed to themſelves the free Adminiſtration or Management of their own Church-eſtates, and ſhook off their <hi>Advocates</hi> of <hi>Vicedams;</hi> yet ſtill the Eccleſiaſtical States are ſubject to the Empire, by reaſon of their <hi>Fees</hi> and other <hi>Regalia</hi>'s, of which they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, if they act any thing inſolently againſt the Publick Peace and the Laws of the Empire. The Monks, as to their Perſons, were, in the times of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, ſubject to the Juriſdiction of the Biſhops, from whom ſome ancient Monaſteries were exempted, and were put immediately under the Pope. The new Orders which have ariſen ſince the XIII. Century, are only ſubject to their Provincials and Generals, and only acknowledge the Pope's Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as their Supreme Ordinary. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Lands of the Abbies were at firſt committed to <hi>Advocates,</hi> from which dependance, in length of time, ſome Houſes were exempted, but the greateſt part have ſtill remained in the ſame ſtate they were at firſt; and ſome few of them are free from all publick Taxes and Charges.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54100:67"/>
way has ſince been much extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what it was at firſt. Theſe were firſt (as to the Secular Courts) to make their Complaints to the <hi>Scabins,</hi> which in ancient times were appointed in all the <hi>(Pagi)</hi> Hundreds and Villages; from him they might appeal to the <hi>Graves</hi> or <hi>Comites, (Earls</hi> or <hi>Sheriffs)</hi> whoſe Juriſdiction was after uſurped by many <hi>Dukes</hi> and <hi>Biſhops.</hi> From the <hi>Counts</hi> or <hi>Graves</hi> they had an Appeal to the <hi>Itinerary Meſſengers,</hi> (or Judges) ſent into the Provinces by the King, and from them to the King himſelf, who in his Court made a final Determination of all Caſes: But in the XV. Century, when Appeals became very frequent, by reaſon of the bringing in the tedious Forms, and the Iniquity of the Rabble; for the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious determining theſe, it was reſolved, to erect a certain fixed Tribunal or Court, which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Chamber of</hi> Spire <hi>erected for Appeals.</hi>
                  </note> was at laſt ſettled at <hi>Spire;</hi> the reaſon of this was not becauſe the Imperial Court was too ambulatory or unſettled, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vaſt quantity of theſe Caſes might moſt conveniently be determined in a place ſet apart for that end. <q>(The <hi>French,</hi> in <note place="margin">

The modern way of Trials now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <note place="margin">The preſent form of Proceſs.</note> in <hi>Germany,</hi> is thus: When any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon commenceth a Suit againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame quality, he in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance goes to the <hi>Praetor (Scabin)</hi> of the City or Village in which he lives, except the Defendant be ſome way priviledged above the <hi>Scabin.</hi> There is in all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities which I have been acquainted with, ſome ſuperiour Court, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the whole Province, which they call the Palace or Provincial Court, and to this Superiour Court there lies an Appeal from the <hi>Scabin:</hi> But then the moſt part of the Free Cities have only one Court, from which there is no Appeal. The Chamber of <hi>Spire,</hi> and the Emperor's <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace-Court,</hi> are common to the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but then ſome of the Princes have a Priviledge which reſtrains their Subjects from appealing to either of theſe Courts, of this number are the Electors: Yet there <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Civil Caſes there is no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the Electors, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and King of</hi> Sweden.</note> are ſome, who queſtion whether this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge belongs to the Eccleſiaſtical Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, only becauſe they do not exerciſe it.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54100:68"/>
The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> enjoy the ſame Exemption for all his <hi>German</hi> Territories. <hi>(Weſtphaliae Art. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>ſect.</hi> 12.)

Capitul. Leopold. Artic.</hi> 28, &amp; 27.) but then all the Princes of the Empire are equal in this, that there lies no Appeal, except the thing in diſpute exceed ſuch a value, which yet in ſome places is more, and in others leſs.

                  <hi>Frederick</hi> II. Son of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. was, after many other, choſen, who yet could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the peaceable Poſſeſſion till the year 1219. ſo that it laſted about 21 years. But to return] It is certain, <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Firſt was not the Author of this Court, though he gave it a new form, which is extant in the <hi>Ordination of the Chamber</hi> in 1495. made at <hi>Worms.</hi> Of the various forms of <hi>Auſtraega</hi>'s there mention'd, there are only two now in uſe; as, 1. The Defendant names Three Princes of the Empire, out of which the Plaintiff chuſeth one: Or, 2. They obtain by conſent of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror one or more Commiſſioners: But then there are ſome Caſes which ought not to be brought before the <hi>Auſtraega,</hi> but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the Chambers of <hi>Spire</hi> or <hi>Vienna;</hi> which may be found in many very common Books. Now, there are theſe Inconveniences alwaies attending the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given by the <hi>Auſtraega</hi>'s; 1. That there lies an Appeal to the Chambers, ſo that very few Controverſies are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them. 2. That great Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney are ſpent in treating and ſweetening the Emperor's Commiſſioners. 3. There is a Sequeſtration of a years continuance of the Profits of the thing in diſpute, which time is allowed to the <hi>Auſtraega</hi>'s, to give in their Award; becauſe it is thought an indecent thing to determine a Suit of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in leſs time in <hi>Germany.</hi>

(And after many Removes, fixed at <hi>Spire,</hi> in the year 1530, by the <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> V. where it remained till this year 1689.) Now, though this Court uſeth the Name of the Emperor only in all its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, yet it doth not depend on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror only, but acts in the behalf, and by the Authority of the States of <hi>Germany:</hi> The Emperor names the <hi>Preſident,</hi> who muſt be a <hi>Prince</hi> of the Empire, or, at leaſt, a <hi>Count</hi> or <hi>Baron.</hi> By the Treaty of <hi>Oſnabruck</hi> it was agreed, that under this prime Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident there ſhould be four other inferiour Preſidents to be nominated by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and at leaſt fifty Aſſeſſors (Judges or Companions with them) Twenty ſix of which ſhould be of the Roman Catholick Religion, and Twenty four of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, to take from the later all juſt cauſe of complaint, that their Caſes were not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably heard and determined: Yet at this day there is rarely half this number, the Princes that ſhould nominate and pay them, being very ſlow in both reſpects, they being much offended with the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Commands of this Court, though they rarely go further than words. He that is deſirous to know the exact form of their Proceedings, muſt read the Order of the Chamber, inſerted into the <hi>Receſs</hi> of the <hi>Diet,</hi> in 1495. It is a common
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54100:69"/>
Proverb, That the Suits at <hi>Spire</hi> are draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, but never die, <hi>(Spirant non expirant.)</hi> This is owing to the litigious forms and delays or perplexities in the Proceſſes, and the number of the Caſes depending before too ſmall a number of Judges to diſpatch them. But yet, after all, the great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, the Difficulty of executing the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; for the Princes that have great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates do very little regard what the Judges at <hi>Spire</hi> ſay: And they again have ſo much wit, that they will not hazard the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their Authority, by giving Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (how juſtly ſoever) againſt a Prince of that Power, that he will deſpiſe both them and their Sentence. But then, in this Court (as in others) if they catch a ſmall Fly, they will be ſure to hamper him. In the year 1654, in a Diet, there were many Rules or Proviſions made for the ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Defects of this Chamber: There lies no Appeal from it, but if any man is aggrieved, he may deſire a Reviſion, which yet, to my knowledge, was never ſought, or never granted.</p>

It is not hard to gueſs what was the true reaſon why the Emperors inſtituted this Court; to which purpoſe it will be fit to conſider, that theſe Princes obſerving, that all Appeals being tried and determined at <hi>Spire,</hi> and that place frequented on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Juſtice, the Court at <hi>Vienna</hi> was in the mean time neglected, to the great diſhonour and diſſatisfaction of the Family of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> For the flying to them for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, is the greateſt of the Glories of a Prince; and their Majeſty is then moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendant, when it gives men their Due, and repells their Injuries: Beſides, he that has the Management of the Oracles of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, can beſt ſecure his own Intereſt, and take care that nothing ſhall be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. Now, the Chamber of <hi>Spire</hi> depended on the whole Body of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and was alſo ſeated at a great diſtance from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and that beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and therefore ſeemed to take but little notice of the <hi>Danube</hi> (that is <hi>Vienna.)</hi> The form of the Law Proceedings being alſo changed, it was now become very difficult to adjuſt and end the Controverſies of the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

States in the <hi>Diet,</hi> as had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practis'd. Now, if the Emperor could by degrees inſenſibly draw them to himſelf only, in conjunction with the Claims of private men, he ſhould thereby gain a great Step toward the acquiring a Soveraign Authority over the States. Nor were there wanting plauſible Reaſons for the opening this Court; for, Why ſhould he be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to adminiſter equal Juſtice to all, if all might paſs by him, and direct their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to <hi>Spire?</hi> This Chamber of <hi>Vienna</hi> pretended alſo not to be tied to the ſlow methods of Proceſs uſed at <hi>Spire;</hi> and men were pleaſed with the expectation of a quick diſpatch of their Caſes; for the Court of <hi>Spire</hi> is ſo hampered, that tho' the Caſe is never ſo plain, and the Judges are never ſo willing to do ſpeedy Juſtice, yet they muſt omit none of their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Forms. Some others, that pretend to a deeper inſpection, ſay there is a private Council at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in which the greateſt Affairs of the Empire are conſidered: Now when any great Caſe has been ventilated and debated in this Court, if the Judges find it has any State-Intereſt in it, they give the Emperor an account of it, with their Thoughts of it, and thereupon it is again debated in that private Council, in which the State-Intereſt of the Caſe is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered than the Juſtice of it. As for the Inſtance; Whether it is for the Emperor's Intereſt, that this or that Judgment ſhould be given; and how and which way the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54100:71"/>
ſhall be made: So that if any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that nature ariſeth, the Judges have private Orders to ſuſpend or delay the Judgment. I preſume, the Judges of this Court would alſo take it very ill to be ſuſpected of Bribery; and yet there are many that think it is their Intereſt to clear themſelves (if they can) of this Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, which might be done by ſhewing to the contending Parties, to which of them the Caſe depending is committed.</p>
               <p n="22">22. As to the form of Execution in <note place="margin">The Form of executing the Judgments of theſe Courts.</note> both theſe High Courts, it is thus: Firſt, They enjoin the Party that is vanquiſhed to ſubmit to the Sentence they have given againſt him, upon pain of forfeiting a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain quantity of Marks of pure Gold, to be paid in part to the Exchequer of the Empire, and in part to the Perſon ſuing; if he doth not obey the Sentence upon notice of this, within the time limited, then the Sum is encreaſed; but if he ſtill perſiſt, and deſpiſe their Threats, he is put under the <hi>Baun,</hi> or proſcribed, and the Sentence is ordered to be put in execution by Force and Arms, till the Party ſubmit. If the Party caſt is a Subject of any of the States, the execution of the Sentence is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that State or Prince whoſe Subject he is. If the Party condemned is a Prince, or Member of the <hi>Diet,</hi> then the General of the Circle, or ſome or other of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers alſo of that Circle to which he belongs, are commanded to execute it: But if the Party is ſo powerful, that the Circle is not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54100:71"/>
able to force him to ſubmit, two or three of the next Circles are commanded to join with them: But this rarely happens, that there are any ſuch Executions to be made; and when there is, it is more for the Intereſt of <hi>Germany,</hi> and for the ſecuring the Liberties of the ſeveral States to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Controverſies of this great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Arbitrators, than by Suits and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Executions thereupon.</p>
               <p n="23">23. If any thing ariſeth which may affect <note place="margin">The greater Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ought to be determin'd in the Diet.</note> the whole Body of the Empire, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror cannot determine of it as he pleaſeth himſelf, but ought to propoſe it in the <hi>Diet,</hi> and it is by the States to be there ordered as they ſhall by common Conſent agree. <hi>(Vid. Capitul. Leopold. Artic.</hi> 39. <hi>ſub fin.)</hi> Now, becauſe all theſe Affairs have been very exactly collected by <hi>German</hi> Writers, it will be ſufficient for us to ſet down here ſome of the principal Heads of them. 1. The Emperor has the ſole Power of aſſembling the <hi>Diet,</hi> but ſo, that he is bound, by his Letters or Envoys, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Conſent of the <hi>Electors,</hi> and alſo to adjuſt with them the Time and Place. <hi>(Capitul. Leopold. Art.</hi> 17.) The <hi>Electors</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may admoniſh the Emperor, when they think it is for the Intereſt of <hi>Germany</hi> there ſhould be a <hi>Diet.</hi> But then, becauſe the holding a <hi>Diet</hi> is a thing of very great Charge to the <hi>States,</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, That the Emperor ſhall not burthen them with the holding unneceſſary Diets. <hi>(Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitul. Leopold. D. E.)</hi> During the vacancy,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54100:72"/>
the <hi>Vicars</hi> of the Empire (the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine)</hi> ſhall aſſemble the <hi>Diet,</hi> and in his abſence, the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if there be one. The calling of it ſhall not be by any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Proclamation, but by written or printed Letters, to be delivered perſonally to each of the States (or Members) which ſhall be penn'd in a kind inviting Stile, and not in an imperious commanding Form like a Citation. The Indiction ſhall be ſix months before the Meeting, that the States may have ſufficient time to conſider what is there to be treated of.</p>
               <p n="24">24. In ancient times there was a <hi>Diet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In ancient times the Diet was held every year.</note> held every year, and it continued but one Month, as is ſuppoſed by the <hi>German An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries;</hi> at this day it is not agreed how often or how long it ſhall ſit, but that is governed by the preſent Neceſſities of the publick Affairs, or at leaſt it ought to be ſo: Yet they have adjudged it expedient for the preſerving the Liberties of the States, that there ſhould be frequent <hi>Diets,</hi> as for inſtance, once in three years at the fartheſt; that when they are, neceſſary care ſhould be taken to expedite the Affairs depending, which now move too ſlowly, and occaſion vaſt expence both of Time and Money, which might be ſaved. There are ſome that are jealous, that theſe affected Delays and Charges are a State-Myſtery, by which the Emperor hopes, in time, to tire out the States, and make them abhor <hi>Diets,</hi> which were otherwiſe the moſt effectual means to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54100:72"/>
ſecure the <hi>German</hi> Liberty. The <hi>Golden Bull</hi> has ordained, That the firſt <hi>Diet</hi> (of every Emperor's Reign) ſhould be at <hi>Norimberg,</hi> which yet is not ſcrupulouſly obſerved now; for in theſe <hi>Capitulars</hi> there is only care taken that it ſhall be held in a convenient place, within the Empire, as ſhall be agreed with the <hi>Electors:</hi> Of a long time ſome one of the Free Imperial Cities has been appointed for that purpoſe, the reaſon of which is not ſo much in the dark; and, I ſuppoſe, the Princes would ſcarce meet, if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſhould appoint <hi>Vienna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. All the Members of the States are, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>All the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are to be ſummoned to the</hi> Diet.</note> without exception, to be called to the Diet; and amongſt the Eccleſiaſticks, thoſe that are not yet confirmed by the Pope, and before they have obtained their Palls, and in the vacancy of any See, the Chapter is to be called. And whereas the Proteſtant Poſſeſſors of Biſhopricks, before the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> were not admitted to the Diet, they in it obtained the Aſſignment of a peculiar Place. As to thoſe Secular Princes that are minors, their Guardians appear for them; and they that are of full age, are to be admitted before they have asked or obtained their Inveſtiture. This is true, though in the Diet of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> in the year 1608. <hi>John Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Wur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temburg</hi> was excepted againſt on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; If in any Family the Right of <hi>Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture</hi> prevails, and is received, only the Eldeſt is called. Thoſe that have divided their Inheritance, are called by Families in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54100:73"/>
general, but they have all but one voice: But thoſe that have obtained the Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Share or Portion from the Emperor, are perſonally called. They that are called to the <hi>Diet,</hi> muſt appear in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; or if this is inconvenient, by their Legates (or <hi>Proxies)</hi> ſufficiently inſtructed<hi>:</hi> Thoſe that neglect to appear, are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs concluded by the majority of thoſe that do appear. By a peculiar Priviledge the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is not bound to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Diet, if it is not held at <hi>Norim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> or <hi>Bamberg.</hi> The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> are at Liberty to appear or not, as they pleaſe. It is not worth our while to ſum up the vain uſeleſs Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="26">26. The things that are to be debated <note place="margin">The things to be debated are propoſed by the Emperor or his Commiſſioner.</note> and ſettled in the Diet, are propoſed by the Emperor, or his Commiſſioner, then they proceed to the Debate; where the firſt Queſtion is, Whether they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the order the things are propoſed, to conſider and determin them; or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall poſtpone ſome of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided, and paſs forward to the reſt of the things propoſed? Here the States pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they are not religiouſly bound to obſerve the Method of the Propoſals; but the Imperial Party (who can eaſily fore ſee what the States drive at) have ever ſtifly pretended, the Method of the Propoſals is to be followed; that the Emperor's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns have ever been wont to lead the Van, and thoſe of the States to follow in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54100:73"/>
the next place. If therefore the States will do their own Buſineſs, they muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity gratifie the Emperor; but then it has been obſerved, that when he has gained his own point, he is ſeldom much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for thoſe things that the States would have. When they come to debate, they are divided into three Colledges (Houſes or Chambers) the <hi>Electors,</hi> the <hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Frée Cities,</hi> which Diviſion is thought to have been firſt made in the year 1589, in the Diet at <hi>Frankford:</hi> In the firſt of theſe the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> is the Director <hi>(Speaker);</hi> in the ſecond, the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> by turns; and in the third, that City in which the Diet is held: The Princes vote man by man, the Counts and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops by <hi>Benches:</hi> The greater part obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the leſſer, except in the Affairs of Religion, in which the States are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one Body, but as Parties, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition each to other. Whether the ſame thing ought to be admitted in the matter of Taxes, or granting Money, is a Queſtion not yet decided. (See the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Weſtphalia, Art.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 19.) I ſhould think this might eaſily be expedited by a Diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Grant tends to the Safety and Security of the whole Body of <hi>Germany,</hi> or is only granted and deſigned for the Benefit of the Emperor? No good <hi>German</hi> would decline contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the firſt; and as to the latter, it is fit every one ſhould be left to his own
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54100:74"/>
liberty, to determin as he ſhall think fit. Their way of Proceeding is this: What is approved by the College of <hi>Electors,</hi> is communicated to the College of <hi>Princes;</hi> this latter returns to the former their Sentiments of it (which is called a <hi>Reference</hi> or <hi>Conference)</hi> and ſo it is tranſacted <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> between theſe two till they agree; then they two join, and communicate their agreed Reſolves to the thrid College or Cities, and if they conſent too, then the unanimous Reſolves of the whole Bodies of the State, are communicated to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, or his Commiſſioner, and when he has approved of it, that Affair is ſettled: If the three Colleges cannot agree, their differing Votes are propoſed to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who in a friendly way, as an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator, and not in a commanding way, as a Maſter or Prince, endeavoureth to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them. In like manner, if his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the ſame with that of the States, it is friendly and fairly argued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, till he is of their mind, or they of his. After this, at the breaking up <hi>(Receſs)</hi> of the States, there is a Solemn Form, containing the things agreed between the Emperor and the States, in the manner of a Contract. As to the College of Cities, it is to be obſerved, that though in the Treaty of Peace <hi>(Art.</hi> 8. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4.) the deciding Vote is aſſigned to it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before others contended, that they were only to be admitted to the Debates (to offer their Reaſons) yet even now they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54100:74"/>
communicate nothing to this Member of the States, but what is agreed by the two other Colleges; but then neither can thoſe two Colleges exact Obedience, or force this third to comply with them againſt their wills, as a major part; but where the third College diſagreeth from the other two, the thing in diſpute is referr'd to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, till a way is found to adjuſt it, and what cannot at laſt be agreed, is wont to be referred to another Diet. What is agreed by the whole Diet, is by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who is Director of the firſt College, and in a ſort, of the whole Diet, drawn and reduced into the form of a <hi>Receſs,</hi> Edict, Decree, or Law, and then it is again conſidered by the States; and after they have all ſubſcribed and ſealed it, then it is publiſhed.</p>
               <p n="27">27. By all this which I have ſaid, it <note place="margin">The Emperor has yet ſome Prerogatives above any other Prince.</note> will eaſily appear how much of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power is left to the Emperor; yet there are ſome Prerogatives which belong only to the Emperor in <hi>Germany;</hi> 1. The Right of the <hi>Firſt Prayers,</hi> by force of which, the Elected Emperor has a Right to preſent one perſon to a Benefice in every of the Eccleſiaſtical Chapters or Colleges. The Emperor has leſs reaſon to be aſhamed of this Reſtriction, than the Clergy, who owing almoſt all their Wealth to the Liberality and Bounty of the firſt Emperors, have been ſo ungrateful as to reſtrain the Succeſſors of their Benefactors to the Collation of a ſingle Benefice, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54100:75"/>
that too to be conſerr'd by way of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, that ſhall not be denied. 2. He gives all ſorts and degrees of Honours or Titles: Yet, (See <hi>Art.</hi> 43, &amp; 44. <hi>Capitul. Leopold.)</hi> 3. He only gives and collates the Inveſtitures of the Princes Fees, and all others that paſs by the Delivery of a <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> 4. He conſtituteth Univerſities. 5. And he only can give leave to build a City. And there are ſome other too of leſs moment.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And from hence it is eaſie to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <note place="margin">The Priviledges of the Princes and free States.</note> how little is wanting to make every of the States Independant Soveraigns; for they, or at leaſt the greateſt part of them, have the intire Power of Life and Death over their reſpective Subjects. They can enact Laws that are contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws of <hi>Germany,</hi> in their own States. They have an intire Liberty as to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They levy Taxes. They make Leagues one with another, and with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, ſo they be not againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and the Empire, (See the <hi>Treaty of Peace, Art.</hi> 8. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. <hi>Capitul. Leopold. chap.</hi> 6, &amp; 8.) which Right is denied the Imperial and Free Cities expreſly. <hi>(Art.</hi> 9. <hi>Capitul. Leopold.)</hi> They defend themſelves with Force and Arms, and revenge their own wrongs, eſpecially if they have to do with Strangers. They build Forts and ſtrong Holds in their Dominions. They mint Moneys, and do all other things neceſſary to the Government of their People. <hi>(Add. Artic.</hi> 33, 34. <hi>Capitul. Leopold. Treaty of Peace,</hi>

                  <hi>Art.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 2.) The 5. <hi>Art. Capitul. Leopold.</hi> belongs only to the Electors; and all theſe things they do in their <hi>own</hi> Names and Rights, and not as the Miniſters of the Emperor. Nor doth it affect their Power ſo much as expreſs the way of having or coming by it, that they acknowledge their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to be Fees holden of the Emperor and Empire; for ſeeing they tranſmit them as an Inheritance to their Children, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture</hi> is rather to be conſidered as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Rite, than as a real and true Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Gift, ſeeing it cannot be denied to any that deſireth it within the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Law. Their Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, which they make to the Emperor, is underſtood with a ſaving of their Rights and Priviledges; and even thoſe that are acknowledged to be Equals each to other, are yet frequently mutually bound one to the other by Oaths. Nor doth their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Diet, at their own Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, prove that they are Subjects; for that is common to all the Aſſemblies of Allies or Confederates. Nor doth their contributing to the Neceſſities of the Empire prove their Subjection for the ſame reaſon. And laſtly, That which ſeems the hardeſt of all, <hi>viz.</hi> That any of theſe States may be ſued in the Supreme Tribunals, or Courts, or Chambers of the Empire; and if they be convicted of any great Offence againſt the Empire, that they may be proſcribed, and deprived of their Dominions; for even this is common to all Confederacies; and there
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54100:76"/>
is an Example of it in Ancient Hiſtory, in the League of the <hi>Amphyctyones</hi> and <hi>Achaeans,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Greeks:</hi> And in our own times, the Confederate or United Provinces thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Groningen,</hi> and bridled it for ſome time with a Citadel. But then the States of <hi>Germany</hi> are very well ſecured the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe vaſt Liberties. <hi>(Capit. Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold. Art.</hi> 28.) But then, if any one of a Confederate or United Society ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently and injuriouſly inſult upon another Confederate, without pretending to claim any Superiority, the reſt of the <hi>Confederates</hi> would have reaſon and right to curb the Exorbitant Member, and force him to do them Juſtice.</p>

It will appear ſufficiently in what has been already ſaid, that the Government, State, or Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> hath ſomething of Irregularity in it, which will not ſuffer us to bring it under any of the ſimple or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular forms of Government, as they are uſually deſcribed by the Maſters of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: We muſt therefore the more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately enquire what its true form is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the far greateſt part of the <hi>German</hi> Writers have made groſs and fooliſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, through their Ignorance in Politicks, and ſenceleſs tranſcribing one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Prudence or Conſideration, by which they have multiplied their Books.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54100:77"/>
I muſt therefore here beſpeak the Pardon of my Reader, if by the ſubject of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry I am forced to uſe more School-Subtilties or Diſtinctions than will pleaſe thoſe that love not that ſort of Learning, becauſe without them it is not poſſible to make a true Repreſentation of, or paſs a ſolid Judgment on the preſent State of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Truth is, a few words would ſatisfie all wiſe men, if the Follies of ſome men that have had the good fortune to be approved, had not made it at once neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and troubleſome to conſute and expoſe them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the ſeveral parts of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <note place="margin">All the Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary States are Monarchies.</note> ſeparately taken or conſidered, there is no difficulty; for all the Secular Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities which go by Inheritance, the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick, which paſs by Election, and the Earldoms, they are all adminiſtred and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned like Monarchies, but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence however, that in ſome places the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are abſolute, and in others they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by certain Pacts, or Agreement with their Provincial States. Amongſt the free <note place="margin">The Free Cities are Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</note> Imperial Cities, ſome are under an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Regiment, the principal manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs being in their Senates, into which their Principal Citizens are elected by the Suffrage or Voices of the Senate; and here the Senate is no way ſubject to the People, nor bound to give any account to them of their Adminiſtration of the Publick Affairs. In other places the <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> is uppermoſt, and the <hi>Form</hi> democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54100:77"/>
and here the Senate is filled by the choice of the Tribes or Companies, and they have alſo a Power to call the Senate to account.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But then the <hi>German</hi> Writers are by <note place="margin">The Form of the whole Body is neither of theſe, but an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Syſtem.</note> no means agreed what Form belongs to the whole Body of the <hi>German Empire,</hi> which is an infallible ſign of an irregular Form, and no leſs alſo of the Ignorance of theſe Authors, who with ſmall Abilities and little Learning, have pretended too haſtily to write of what they did not underſtand; yet I do not remember I ever ſaw one Author that did ſay, it was a <hi>Democraſie;</hi> yet ſome have had ſo little wit as to ſay, none were parts of this State, but thoſe that had a Right to vote in the Diet; in this, without doubt, blindly following <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> who defines a Citizen to be <hi>one that has a Right to deliberate and vote in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Affairs</hi> Now, if we could grant this, then it would be a <hi>Democraſie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all its Parts are compoſed of the States only, who have every one of them a Right to debate and vote in the Diet, and the Emperor is the Prince or Head of the State, but he that ſhould extend that Definition further than the popular Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> for whom only it was made, would certainly be guilty of very great Abſurdities: For, who can think that Freemen (and Gentlemen too) who have great Eſtates and Families of their own, and live in Kingdoms or Commonwealths, are not to be accounted <note n="*" place="margin">Cives</note> Members of

There is no reaſon (ſay they) that any man ſhould be removed from this Opinion by the outſide appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things which ſeem to repreſent to us a Monarchy, <hi>viz.</hi> The proud Flouriſhes of great Titles, and the uſual Forms of Addreſs; much of which is owing to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, which abounds in ſuch vain, inſignificant, luxuriant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and the reſt proceed from the ancient form of Government, (which was indeed Monarchical) though the preſent is nothing leſs; for they in truth are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Supreme Authority, who diſpatch the greateſt Affairs of the State as they themſelves think fit, by what Title ſoever they are call'd. 2. That it is not at all contrary to the nature of an <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſie,</hi> to have an Head a little higher than the reſt, who may be the Director of their Councils, and the Preſident of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and on that Score be of greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than the reſt. 3. That the form of any State ought to be diſtinguiſhed from the manner of its Adminiſtration; which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54100:78"/>
diſtinction is to be thus explicated<hi>:</hi> That it ſometimes happeneth, that one State imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the manner of Adminiſtration proper to, or very like, that of another Form of Government, or which at leaſt may have ſome ſigns of it. Thus, if a King that is a real Monarch, thinks fit to conſult his People, or a Senate of them, the firſt of theſe will ſeem to have ſomething of a Democraſie, and the latter of an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſie, and yet, after all, the Form is a real Monarchy, and nothing elſe; for theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the People or Senate are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Aſſembly of Counſellors, and the King has no neceſſary dependance on them. And on the contrary, in a <hi>Democraſie</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocraſie,</hi> the principal Magiſtrate or Prince of the Senate, who has the Office of conſulting the Senate or Aſſembly in all publick Affairs, of executing the Laws, and enforcing their Decrees, and in whoſe Name the publick Acts and Decrees are made; will indeed be a lively Figure of a Monarch, but yet ſtill the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority will nevertheleſs ſtill reſide in the People or Senate. There are ſome indeed who oppoſe this diſtinction chiefly on this ground; Becauſe the <hi>Form</hi> is the beginning or firſt mover of Operations, and they muſt of neceſſity follow the nature of their effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſe. Now (ſay they) the Form of a State is as it were the Fountain from whence all the Operations pertaining to the Adminiſtration of that State flow, and therefore it is impoſſible the Form ſhould
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54100:79"/>
differ from the Adminiſtration. To this others reply, That we ought to diſtinguiſh in theſe Caſes between what one doth in his own Name or Right, and what he doth in anothers. In the firſt of theſe there can be no difference between the Form and the Manner of Adminiſtration; in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is not impoſſible for a man to ſeem to be what he really is not: The thing in ſhort is thus; <hi>The different Forms of States or Governments reſult or ſpring from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Subject, to whom the Supreme Power is committed or annexed, as it is a ſingle Perſon, or a Council or Senate, conſiſting of a few men, or of all the People; but then, what Miniſters are employed by them that have that Power in the executing of it, is nothing to the purpoſe, or all one.</hi> I might ſay alſo, that Axiom on which the Argument reſteth, is only true in natural Agents, but cannot rightly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied (as it is here) to free Agents, who can govern their Actions as they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But then, though theſe things may <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> German <hi>Empire is no Ariſtocraſie.</hi>
                  </note> thus with Subtilty enough be diſputed in the Schools, yet no wiſe man will thereby be perſwaded to think the <hi>German</hi> Empire is an <hi>Ariſtocraſie,</hi> eſpecially if he has any competent degree of Civil or Politick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Knowledge, becauſe the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an <hi>Ariſtocraſie</hi> lies in the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Supreme Authority to a fixed and perpetual Senate or Council, which has a Right to deliberate, conſult on, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all the publick Concerns and Affairs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54100:79"/>
of that State, committing only the daily and emergent Affairs to ſome Magiſtrates, who are to execute the ſame, and are bound to give an account of their Actions to that Senate: But then there is no ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in <hi>Germany;</hi> for the Chambers of <hi>Spire</hi> and <hi>Vienna</hi> do only judge of Appeals; and the <hi>Diet</hi> is not holden as a ſettled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Senate, which has the Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and is to direct all the publick Affairs of a State, ought to be; but has ever been call'd upon particular and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Cauſes. There are ſome ſo weak, as to conclude the <hi>German</hi> Empire is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly an <hi>Ariſtocraſie,</hi> only becauſe in the Diet things paſs by a majority of Votes; for in many Kingdoms there are Parliaments or Aſſemblies of the States, which are of the ſame nature with the Diets of <hi>Germany,</hi> and in them too the majority of Voices prevails, and yet they are Monarchies and not Ariſtocraſies; as for example, <hi>England, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> What is more uſual, than for a Syſtem of States, which are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by a ſtrict League and Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to hold their Aſſemblies, Diets, or Parliaments? And thus have all of them as much Power over the Members of their States, as the Diet of <hi>Germany</hi> have over the States, that compoſe it. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the <hi>Amphyctyones</hi> and <hi>Achaeans</hi> in old times, and the Diets of the <hi>Cantons</hi> in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> and the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and the Aſſemblies of the United Provinces, in their States-General at the <hi>Hagne,</hi> in latter times; are
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54100:80"/>
full and clear Inſtances of this; and true Ariſtocraſies have all of them this in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>viz.</hi> That no one in the Senate is ſuperiour to the whole Senate; and they all of them are bound as much to obey the Decree of the major part of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as any other Subject; and the Senate has a Power of Life and Death over all the Members of it, which is by no means true of the Diet of <hi>Germany:</hi> And in an Ariſtocraſie the Senators have their private Eſtates, which commonly are greater than thoſe of the private Subjects, yet not only the publick Revenues, but the private Eſtates of the Senators are as much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Laws and Decrees of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as the Eſtates of private men: But in <hi>Germany,</hi> if you remove out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that which belongs to the ſeveral Members of the State, there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for the Diet or Body to diſpoſe of: And it would be a great abatement of the <hi>German Liberty</hi> to aſſert the Diet there has the ſame Authority over the Eſtates of its Members, that the Senate of the moſt Serene Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> has over thoſe of its Senators. As to that famous Speech of <hi>Albert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> when the Electors were conſidering whether they ſhould elect <hi>Charles</hi> V. or <hi>Francis</hi> I. <hi>That the Government of</hi> France <hi>was too Monarchical, and that the Princes of</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <hi>did rather incline to an Ariſtocraſie, which they ought carefully to preſerve.</hi> This may eaſily be thus anſwered: There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

to ſuppoſe that Prelate had any exact knowledge of Politicks, and the ſence of what he ſaid is true, though he has ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That if the <hi>German</hi> Princes were deſirous to continue in the ſame condition they then were, they were to avoid the Empire or Government of a King of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe great deſign it ever was, to reduce the Nobility of their own Kingdom under the Laws of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchy, and would, without all doubt, endeavour to do the ſame thing in <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. It remains now, that we conſider <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> German <hi>Empire no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
                  </note> whether it may be taken into the Liſt or Number of Monarchies or Kingdoms; of theſe there are two ſorts, the <hi>Abſolute</hi> and the <hi>Limited.</hi> In the firſt, the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power is in the hands of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, (by what Title ſoever he is call'd) and he governs all the publick Affairs as he himſelf pleaſeth. But in the latter the King is bound up by certain Laws in the exerciſe of the Soveraign Power. All thoſe that have not exactly conſidered the Difference between theſe two <hi>Species</hi> of Monarchies, have committed great Errors, whilſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Emperor has not an <hi>Abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,</hi> they falſly conclude, that he has not a <hi>Limited</hi> neither. Now, he that can think the Emperor is an <hi>Abſolute Monarch,</hi> is wonderful ſilly, and the Arguments that are brought for it, deſerve rather to be <hi>hiſſed</hi> at than anſwered ſeriouſly. It is full as abſurd to fetch an Argument to prove
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54100:81"/>
the <hi>German</hi> Emperor <hi>abſolute,</hi> from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as from the Books of the <hi>Civil Law:</hi> That the Emperor has no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour but God, and the Sword gives him no more Abſolute Authority over the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> than it gives to the State of <hi>Holland</hi> over the other Six, who may as truly ſay this as he. As to the empty Titles, (as for example, that he is by all the States and Princes ſtiled their moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Lord, and that in the concluſion of their Letters they promiſe much in the Matter of Loyalty and Obedience to him) the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Age, the Stile of the Times are reſponſable for them, and there is no more to be expected from them than from other Expreſſions of Honour and Reſpect, in which the moſt unwilling to act is the moſt forward to promiſe what he never means to perform. That Plenitude and Perfection of Power which the Secretaries and Clerks aſcribe to the Emperor, in their Letters and Decrees, is a meer Jargon of inſignificant words. The States do indeed ſwear Allegiance to the Emperor, but with a ſaving of their own Liberties and Rights. And I have already ſufficiently ſhewn what Power is thereby reſerved and ſecured to them; but to uſe any more words in ſo plain a caſe, were not only needleſs but fooliſh.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Opinion of thoſe who have aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note place="margin">That it is no Limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</note> to the Emperor a Supreme Regal Power, but limited and reſtrained within the Bounds of certain Laws, has ſeemed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54100:81"/>
the moſt probable of all other to the greateſt part of men; and you ſhall alſo frequently hear this Opinion defended and ſtoutly maintained in the Schools of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> The firſt that appeared openly againſt <note place="margin">Hippolithus <hi>a</hi> Lapide <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</hi>
                  </note> this Opinion was a nameleſs Author, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the feigned Title of <hi>Hippolithus</hi> a <hi>Lapide,</hi> in the heat of the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Swediſh</hi> War. This Writer ſaith many things of unqueſtionable veracity, which no modeſt man can deny; but then it is no leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, his implacable Hatred to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> has in other things mis-led and deceived him. The prohibiting the reading of this Book was the only thing that gave it Reputation, and made Learned men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after it; ſo that it was read with unuſual Application and Care: Yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhould never have mention'd it, but that I find many ſtill ſo fond of it, that they ſtill think it an invaluable Treaſure, and that all thoſe that have pretended to anſwer it, have rather trifled with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or baſely flattered the Emperor, than deſtroyed his Reaſons. This Author has well and clearly proved, that the Emperor has not a Supreme and Regal Authority over the Princes and States of <hi>Germany;</hi> but then is ſtrangely abſurd, when he makes the Emperor ſubject to the States, and gives him nothing but the naked Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a ſubordinate Magiſtrate, that wears a great many proud Titles precariouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him; as if whereever the Monarchy is not Abſolute, it muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54100:82"/>
degenerate into an <hi>Ariſtocraſie,</hi> and a Prince muſt preſently acknowledge all thoſe to be his Superiors, whom he could not command and govern as he pleaſed. He that obſerves this one Miſtake, will be able by it to unravel and disbowel all his weak Arguments: And yet, beſides this, he mingles many other ſilly Fallacies, of which I ſhall mention ſome few to expoſe his Folly. To prove that the Soveraign Majeſty is alwaies in the Princes, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, That it is in them when the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Throne is vacant. But who knows not that? In all other Kingdoms, during the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> the Soveraign Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into the hands of the People, or of their Repreſentatives the States, which yet they can retain no longer, than till they have made a new King: Nor doth a man preſently make every one his Maſter, to whom he willingly gives an account of his Actions: It is one thing to give an account to a Superiour, who can puniſh me if I have not performed my Duty to his ſatisfaction, and quite another thing to do it to one who expects it according to an Agreement to that purpoſe made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; and it is yet leſs, when I do it to preſerve my own Reputation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Motive or Reaſon. Thus Kings, when they begin a War, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſatisfie all the World in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of their Cauſe. Thus one Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Partner gives the other, and a Guardian gives the Pupil when he comes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54100:82"/>
to Age an account of his Adminiſtration. Nor is he anothers Maſter and Superiour, who can remove him from his Office; for that a man may by Compact and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be preferred to the management of their common Concerns, ſo that neither of theſe may have any direct and true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Soveraignty over the other, and ſo when he doth not pleaſe the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for that cauſe is depoſed or turn'd out of his Adminiſtration, it has no other effect or cauſe than the breaking off the Bargain made with him, becauſe he has not performed his part of the Contract, and ſatisfied the Conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And yet perhaps a man might doubt whether all that was done in the Caſes of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and <hi>Adolph</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> were legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regularly done, but that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious the Reverend Biſhops of thoſe Ages were the principal Agents in thoſe Affairs. What he ſo largely argues from the Power of the <hi>Diet</hi> are true, as to the matter of Fact, but nothing to his purpoſe for which he alledgeth them; for though the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror can in truth do nothing againſt the Conſent of the States, yet I think it is as true, that no man ever heard the States pretended to do any thing without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Emperor. The Electors, in their <hi>Capitular,</hi> do preſcribe to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror what he ſhall, and what he ſhall not do; not by force of any Authority they have, or pretend to have over him, but by way of Contract: So that if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54100:83"/>
ſhould pretend to enjoin any thing contrary to his Covenants with them, they may ſafely and lawfully not obey him in thoſe Inſtances<hi>:</hi> But then, this ſprings from the nature of all Contracts, and not from any Authority the Electors have over the Emperor. That is more probable yet that he alledgeth from Ancient Cuſtom and the <hi>Golden Bull, viz.</hi> That if the Emperor ſhould happen to be complained of, in certain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, he ſhall be bound to anſwer the Complaint before the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> And it is well known, that the <hi>Three Spiritual Electors</hi> cited <hi>Albert</hi> I. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, before <hi>Rudolph</hi> Count <hi>Palatine</hi> to plead his Cauſe and defend himſelf; but then, when they had ſo great a Criminal to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with, they relied more on their Swords and Armies, than on their Counſel or Judge. But then, ſince the Date of the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> there is not one Example to be found of any ſuch Suit commenc'd againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, that I have read of. The Riſe of that Authority which the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> has, did, without doubt, ſpring from his Office, which in ancient time, as <hi>Mayor</hi> of the Palace, he exerciſed in the King's Court: For as he exerciſed a real Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the other Courtiers, ſo if any thing was demanded of the King, which was doubted of, it was wont to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Examination of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> to whoſe Sentence the King ſtood, not becauſe he owned the Count (who was his Servant and Subject) for his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54100:83"/>
but becauſe when he once knew the Petitioner had Right to what he asked, it was beneath a King to do him wrong; As we have known many Princes in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and elſewhere, who when they doubted of any Debt demanded of them, have anſwered the Claim in their own Courts. And yet it is not to be ſuppoſed that theſe Courts have any Authority over their Princes, or could force them to pay thoſe Debts, if the Reverence they bear to Juſtice, the Publick, and their own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conſcience, and the deſire they natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have to preſerve a good Reputation in the World, did not much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully move them to pay them, than the Authority of theſe Courts, which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by their Subjects and Servants. And I believe the States of <hi>Germany</hi> think they are happy enough in this Priviledge, That the Emperor can exact nothing of them againſt their wills; and that the Wiſeſt of them would diſclaim the Invidious Liberty of commanding their own Emperor.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Doubtleſs the Emperor would with <note place="margin">The Arguments of thoſe that pretend it is a Limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> great facility compound the Diſpute with our <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> and obtain his Leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Prince ſtill, and not be reduced by him to the mean condition of a Subject: But they are not ſo eaſily baffled, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Emperor to be a Soveraign, but Limited King, and aſcribe unto the States great Liberties, but tempered too by Laws, and ſo place <hi>Germany</hi> in the Liſt of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchies; for, as for thoſe who
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54100:84"/>
prate of mixed forms of Government, they can never diſintangle themſelves from the Objections brought againſt them, for that not only all kinds of mixture can produce nothing at laſt but a monſtrous deformed Government, but it is alſo certain none of the Notions of that kind will at all fit <hi>Germany,</hi> in which the whole Supreme Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is not undividedly in the hands of many, nor are the Parts of it divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween divers Perſons or Colleges here. But to return to our former Monarchiſts, They pretend that the <hi>Capitulars</hi> made with the Emperors when they are choſen, are not at all inconſiſtent with the nature of a Limited Monarchy; as for inſtance: That he is bound to adminiſter the Government according to the Fundamental Laws, and to require the Conſent of the States in their Diet, for thoſe things that are of the greateſt moment: That he cannot enact new Laws without their Conſent, nor change any thing in the matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor make War or Peace, or enter Leagues, without the Approbation of his Subjects: That he muſt determine their Controverſies in certain known Courts, and by Stated Laws and Methods. And whereas the Princes and States ſwear Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity both to the <hi>Empire</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi> this they think may be thus explained: That they will obey the Emperor as far as he ſhall employ their Aſſiſtance and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to the Publick Good, and as far as is expreſſed in the Laws; and that as to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54100:84"/>
the reſt of the States, they will live like good Neighbours and true Fellow-Subjects. But ſtill at laſt there are two things that will not ſuffer us to reckon <hi>Germany</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Limited Monarchies:</hi> Firſt, In <note place="margin">Two Arguments againſt This.</note> every Limitted Kingdom, though the King is bound up by ſome certain Laws in the management of its Government, yet after all, he ſo far excells all his Subjects, that none of them dares preſume to compare his Liberty or his Rights with the Power of his Prince; and therefore all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity depend on the Will of the King, and are reſponſable to him for their Actions. Now, that it is otherwiſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> is known to all the World; for none of the <hi>German</hi> Princes or States will acknowledg, that the Dominions which are under them are more the Emperor's than they are theirs, or that they are bound in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to have reſpect more to the Service of the Emperor, or the People, than to their own Perſonal Profit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. But on the contrary, every one of them is ſo far a Soveraign, that he makes War upon his Neighbours at home or abroad, and entereth into Leagues with his Neighbours or Foreigners, without ever conſulting the Emperor; and every one of them that can truſt to his own Forces, or thoſe of his Allies, looks upon the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he ows to the Emperor, as a meer empty piece of Pageantry. To conclude, every King, how Limited ſoever he may otherwiſe be, muſt ſtill have ſufficient
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54100:85"/>
Power left to command all the Forces of his whole Kingdom, and direct them as he thinks fit, ſo that the laſt Reſort may be to him, and the ſaid Forces be united in him as their Head, for the procuring the Common Good, ſo that they may ſeem all of them to be, as it were, animated and governed by one Soul. Now he that can ſee or find this in <hi>Germany,</hi> muſt be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully quick-ſighted; for there he that is call'd their King, has no Revenues from the Empire, but is forced to live by his own Juice, there being no common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; nor are there any common Forces, but every Prince and State diſpoſeth of the Forces and Revenues in his own Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, as he or they think fit, and only contributes to the Publick ſome ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that after tedious Delays, and much humble Attendance and Courtſhip for it. All which things have been fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved in the Chapter before this, and are found evidently true in the Actions of theſe Princes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is now nothing left for us to <note place="margin">That it is an irregular Syſtem of Soveraign States.</note> ſay, but that <hi>Germany</hi> is an Irregular Body, and like ſome mis-ſhapen Monſter, if it be meaſured by the common Rules of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks and Civil Prudence. So that in length of time, by the Lazy-eaſineſs of the Emperors, the Ambition of the Princes, and the Turbulence of the Clergy or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from a Regular Kingdom it ſunk and degenerated to that degree, that it is not now ſo much as a <hi>Limited Kingdom,</hi> (tho'
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54100:85"/>
the outward Shews and Appearances would ſeem to inſinuate ſo much) nor is it a <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Syſtem</hi> of many Soveraign States and Princes, knit and united in a League, but ſomething (without a Name) that fluctates between theſe two. This Irregularity in its Conſtitution affords the matter of an inextricable and incurable Diſeaſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny internal Convulſions, whilſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is alwaies labouring to reduce it to the condition of a Regular Empire, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Monarchy; and the States on the other ſide are reſtleſly acquiring to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a full and perfect Liberty. But then, as it is the nature of all Degenerations, that they go forward in their Degeneracy and Corruption with great Facility, (it being a down-hill motion) but they can hardly, and with much difficulty, be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the priſtine or ancient ſtate; for, as a Stone laid on the edge of a Precipice or Downfall, is with the ſmalleſt Thruſt thrown down to the bottom, but it is not to be replaced again at the top without great and almoſt inſuperable difficulty: So now <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> without great Commotions, and the utmoſt Confuſion of all things, can never be reformed or reduced to the Laws of a Juſt and Regular Kingdom, but it tends naturally to the ſtate of a <hi>Confederate Syſtem.</hi> Nay, if you take away the mutual Bond or Tie between the Emperor and the States, (I ſuppoſe he means their Oaths) <hi>Germany</hi> would then truly be a <hi>Syſtem of States,</hi> united in an unequal League, becauſe

thoſe that are called the <hi>States,</hi> are ſtill bound to reverence the Imperial Majeſty, as their Head. For a <hi>Free State,</hi> we may take for our Example of this, the League between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Latin People,</hi> before the latter were reduced into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of meer <hi>Subjects.</hi> So the Generalſhip of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> in the Warlike Expedition of the <hi>Greeks</hi> againſt the <hi>Trojans,</hi> was of the ſame nature: And it commonly comes to paſs, in length of time, that he that is the Superiour in theſe Leagues, if he has much the advantage of his Allies in point of Power, by degrees he ſinks them into the condition of meer Subjects, and ſo treats them. Thus the beſt account we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly give of the Preſent State of <hi>Germany,</hi> is to ſay, <hi>That it comes very near a Syſtem of many Soveraign States, in which one Prince or General of the League excells the reſt of the Confederates, and is cloathed with the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Soveraign Prince; but then this Body is attack'd by furious Diſeaſes;</hi> of which I ſhall treat in the next Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Strength and Diſeaſes of the <hi>German Empire.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Forces of any State may be conſidered as they are in themſelves, or as by reaſon of the elegant Structure of its Form or Conſtitution they may be uſed. Forces conſidered in themſelves, conſiſt in <note place="margin">The Subjects of Humane Force.</note> 
                  <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Things.</hi> As to the firſt of theſe, <hi>Men, Germany</hi> has no reaſon to complain that it wants numbers of them, or they Wit or Ingenuity; there is ſo great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the principal Nobility, and they too are in ſuch ſplendid circumſtances, that there is ſcarcely the like to be found elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in all the World. The Gentry or Inferiour Nobility are neither for want of Ground, or by their over-great number compell'd to condeſcend to the exerciſe of mean and ſordid Arts (Trades) Perhaps yet there are more of them employed in Learning than is convenient, though amongſt the many Graduates there are not many eminent Scholars. Of Merchants, Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Mechanicks there is a great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But then in many places there is now
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54100:87"/>
a want of Husbandmen, conſidering the largeneſs of the Country. This is owing <note place="margin">Husbandmen moſt wanted.</note> partly to the Thirty years War, by which <hi>Germany</hi> was moſt miſerably deſolated; and partly becauſe the Countrymen are of that Temper, that as ſoon as they arrive at any conſiderable Eſtate, they put out their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Trades,</hi> as thinking thoſe that live in the Cities much more happy than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Though I can ſcarce think that any Man had ſo much leiſure as to take an exact account of the Cities and Burroughs of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> yet I believe no man would be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by one that knew that Country, if he ſhould ſay, that an Army of Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Men might be levied, by <note place="margin">A vaſt Army may be eaſily levyed.</note> taking out of every City five men, and out of every Burrough-Town one, or two at moſt. For a Specimen of this, there are ſome Authors that ſay, That in the Ten Circles there are 1957 Cities, Towns, and Caſtles, beſides the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in which, in the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> I. there were 102 Cities, and 308 Towns, and 258 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Caſtles, 171 Monaſteries, and of Villages 30363. In <hi>Sileſia</hi> there are 411 Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, 863 Towns, and 51112 Villages. In <hi>Moravia</hi> there are 100 Cities, 410 Towns, 30360 Villages, and before the Proteſtants deſtroyed them, there were 11024 Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Priories, Abbies, and Nunneries. Thus <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. is, by his Zeal for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaid to have brought into her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion One hundred thouſand men. This Nation is not only thus wonderfully Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54100:87"/>
but from all times of which any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory has been preſerved, it has been ever <note place="margin">The Inhabitants as warlike as numerous.</note> famous for War, and greedy of Military Glory, ſpending freely, for a little Money, its Blood in all the Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> As they are not over-hot in their Paſſions, ſo they are very conſtant, and have Souls very capable of Diſcipline and Inſtruction. Nor is this Nation leſs to be admired and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their Mechanick Arts and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Manufactures: And which crowns all, <note place="margin">Steddy and conſtant in their Humours.</note> and tends wonderfully to the Security and Welfare of Societies, they are not at all inclined to promote Changes in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and can with Patience and Submiſſion endure the moſt Rigid Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q>

                     <hi>Nation has all the German Virtues, which they brought over with them, but theſe laſt; for no Government will long pleaſe us, being too much addicted to hope for better days in other Publick Circumſtances: And we are certainly the Nation in the whole World that can the worſt bear an overlooſe remiſs Government, or a rigid ſevere one, eſpecially if not regulated exactly by Laws.]</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Amongſt the things in which the <note place="margin">In the point of Strength the Country firſt to be conſidered.</note> Strength of a Nation conſiſteth, the firſt that is to be conſidered is, the <hi>Country</hi> it ſelf: As to the extent of it, that may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be known, by travelling from <hi>Caſſuben</hi> upon the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> in the further <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania,</hi> to <hi>Montpelgart,</hi> upon the River <hi>Alain,</hi> 33 Miles from <hi>Baſil</hi> to the <hi>Weſt;</hi> or from the furtheſt parts of <hi>Holſtein, N. W.</hi> to the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54100:88"/>
fartheſt part of <hi>Carniola, S. E.</hi> or from <hi>Liege</hi> in the <hi>W.</hi> to the utmoſt <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Border of <hi>Sileſia.</hi> In this vaſt-extended Region, if you except the top of the <hi>Alps,</hi> there are very few places which produce nothing uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Life of Man; but there are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where that Plenty of Neceſſaries, that it wants nothing from abroad, but what may promote Luxury and Superfluous Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The Mines, and ſome Rivers, afford a little Gold, and all its Precious Stones are of ſmall value: But then there is ſome Silver, and great plenty of Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Quickſilver, and other Metals of leſs price, digged out of the Earth in very many places. The Fountains afford as much Salt as the Country needeth, though in all the Countries bordering on the Sea, and the Navigable Rivers, they generally uſe Salt brought from <hi>France, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> They have great. Plenty of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Wood, Cloathing,</hi> both <hi>Linen</hi> and <hi>Woollen;</hi> as alſo <hi>Horſes, great Cattel</hi> and <hi>ſmall,</hi> and <hi>Wild Beaſts;</hi> and they want not thoſe Liquors that will make them drunk. So that in the whole, <hi>Germany</hi> may be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Wealthy Region, becauſe it not only produceth thoſe Metals of which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is minted, but all other things too, which are required to the Support or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Humane Life, in that plenty, that it can ſerve all its own Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and afford great quantities to be tranſported to Foreign Nations, and thoſe that are imported from abroad, are either
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54100:88"/>
much leſs in value, or ſuch things as the <hi>Germans</hi> might conveniently live without, if they knew how to ſuppreſs their Luxury, or lay by their Lazineſs and Folly. As for example: How eaſie were it for them to be well content with their own <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Beer?</hi> Or if they are not ſufficient to make them drunk enough, they might quicken the operation thereof with the helliſh ſteams of <hi>Brandy,</hi> and in the mean time never know or regard the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Wines. How eaſie were it for the <hi>Germans</hi> to cloath themſelves with their own Cloth, made of their own Wools, and leave the <hi>Spaniſh, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> to wear theirs too? Or if they are taken with the beauty and fineneſs of them, then they ought to have encouraged their own Workmen to mend the Manufacture. Nor would it be any Grievance to the <hi>Germans</hi> to want the <hi>Italian</hi> Silks: Or if they muſt needs be well and finely clad, the parts about the <hi>Rhine</hi> produce ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Mulberry Trees;</hi> and ſo they might have Silk too, if the Inhabitants could once perſwade themſelves to mind ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Vineyards<hi>:</hi> Thus having <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries</hi> and <hi>Silkworms,</hi> they might (if they pleaſed) learn the Art of making <hi>Silks.</hi> And though it may perhaps be reaſonable to impute the <hi>Germans</hi> affecting the <hi>French</hi> Faſhions to the ſimplicity of this Nation, as believing it becomes them much more than their own: Yet it cannot be denied, but it is a piece of intolerable Folly to fetch
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54100:89"/>
their Stuffs, which are not fit for us; nay, the very Name of <hi>French</hi> Goods enhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the value and eſteem of what would otherwiſe be ſlighted: The <hi>Frenchmens</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſo often the Figures and Forms of their Stuffs, is not an Argument of their Levity and Inconſtancy, as ſome think, but a very crafty Deſign, for by this means they prevent the <hi>German</hi> Workmen from ever imitating them; though in truth the greateſt part of the Artificers of <hi>Germany</hi> think it a Sin to vary from the received method they have once ſetled in their Trades; nor can they poſſibly perſwade themſelves, that there is any thing in the new Inventions which is good, or to be imitated, becauſe forſooth it was not known to their Grandſires. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If <hi>Germany</hi> could poſſibly command and rule its own Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, much leſs <hi>Sugar</hi> and <hi>Spices,</hi> which with other things of that nature are brought from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> would then ſerve it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor doth <hi>Germany</hi> want the means of <note place="margin">Germany <hi>well ſtored with what will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on a Trade.</hi>
                  </note> drawing to it ſelf the Riches of other Countries by Commerce: To that purpoſe it is required, that the Situation of a Country be convenient for the paſſage of its Inhabitants to other Nations, and alſo the reception of Strangers amongſt them; and laſtly, that the Inhabitants may have ſomething to ſpare, which they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port into Foreign Nations. Now all thoſe Cities are very conveniently ſeated for a Trade, which ſtand upon the <hi>Ocean</hi> and the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54100:89"/>
                  <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> and the Inland Towns which ſtand upon great and navigable Rivers, on the account of the cheapneſs of Carriage: for all Merchandiſe which is carried by a Land-Carriage, affords little profit, by reaſon of the charge. The Goods which are exported out of <hi>Germany</hi> are theſe that follow. <hi>Iron,</hi> wrought and unwrought, <note place="margin">Their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</note> 
                  <hi>Lead, Quick ſilver, Wine, Beer, Brandy, Corn, Wool, Courſe Cloth,</hi> and ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Cloth, Linens, Horſes, Sheep, &amp;c.</hi> And yet I cannot deny, but after all, there appears a far greater plenty of Money in other Countries, than in <hi>Germany;</hi> and there ſeems to be many reaſons for it: For, 1. What wonder is it, that a Country <note place="margin">Yet ſhe wants Money, and the Reaſons why.</note> ſhould appear exhauſted, which has endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a War of Thirty years continuance, and has in all that time been expoſed to the Ravage of its own and foreign Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. 2. There are other Countries which are placed much better for a Trade than <hi>Germany,</hi> becauſe there are very few, in compariſon of the <hi>German</hi> Cities, which ſtand well for it; when as on the contrary, the Sea favoureth much more <hi>England, Italy, Spain, Fortugal, France,</hi> and the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi> 3. There are other Countries which have Countries ſubject to them that are no parts of them, and ſo repreſent the Wealth' of many Nations in a ſmall room crowded together. This is the caſe of <hi>Spain, Portugal, England,</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> but <hi>Germany</hi> has no Dominions without its own Bounds to enrich it. 4. The Beauty
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54100:90"/>
and Greatneſs of the capital Cities in other Countries, in which the Wealth of a whole Nation is ſometimes contracted, ſtrikes the Eyes, and excites the Wonder of a Stranger. Thus many ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple judge of the Riches of <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Paris;</hi> by <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Lisbonne</hi> they judge of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> but in ſo vaſt a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as <hi>Germany,</hi> the Riches, which are ſo very much diſperſed, muſt neceſſarily ſeem leſs than indeed they are. 5. Much of the Money of <hi>Germany</hi> is by the Folly of its Natives carried into foreign Countries, for Commodities they might either have at home, or eaſily be without. 6. I know not whether I ought not to add, That the Travels of the <hi>German</hi> Youth into Foreign Countries, ſpends much of their Money, which is drawn over into thoſe parts; for though perhaps it is not amiſs to have the <hi>German</hi> Ruſticity and Dulneſs allayed and tempered by the Converſation of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; yet I think on the other ſide they deſerve Scorn or Pity, who bring out of <hi>Italy</hi> no other Improvements, but a Sett of Sins, unknown before in their native Country, together with ſome new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of forms of Swearing, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming God. Nor doth <hi>France</hi> for the moſt part return thoſe that travel in it with any better Accompliſhments than that of a ſordid Luxury, and an exact experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge of the various degrees and kinds of the Venereal Mange: Yet there are ſome who had not the patience to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54100:90"/>
earn the Title of a <hi>Doctor</hi> at home, by many years Study and Applications, but having taken a great turn in <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> are ever after counted wonderfully learned: And a Foreigner too may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the Title of <hi>Doctor</hi> much cheaper in <hi>Italy</hi> than in <hi>Germany,</hi> and with leſs Breach of his Modeſty; and this and their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is all they bring home with them, though in truth for their Honour it may be ſaid, There are a great many <hi>German</hi> Doctors as errant Blockheads as they.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then, ſeeing no man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Strength of</hi> Germany <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with its Neighbours.</hi>
                  </note> and truly be ſaid to be ſtrong or weak, till he is compared with others, let us in the next place compare the Forces of <hi>Germany</hi> with its neighbour Nations. <hi>Germany</hi> bordereth to the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> upon the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire in <hi>Stiria, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Croatia,</hi> theſe two, though not parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> being its Ramperts. Now, tho' <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Firſt, with the</hi> Turks.</note> the <hi>Turks,</hi> from their large Dominions, can raiſe much more Money and Men, yet there is no great reaſon for the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to fear them; for he can only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault a corner of this Empire, where it terminates in a ſharp Angle like a Wedg, and that at a great diſtance from the Heart or Regal City of <hi>Turkey;</hi> ſo that they never make an <hi>Hungarian</hi> War, but at a vaſt Charge and Expence. Nor are the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Souldiers to be compared with the <hi>German,</hi> when they are well exerciſed, for Strength or Hardineſs; and therefore the <hi>Aſian</hi> Forces are with great difficulty
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54100:91"/>
brought hither, where they cannot bear the coldneſs and ſharpneſs of the Air; and whilſt all their Forces are thus drawn to the Extremity of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, the oppoſite parts are left naked and defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the Inroads of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſeldom fail to take theſe favourable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. And then, becauſe <hi>Servia, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia,</hi> and that part of <hi>Hungary</hi> which is poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> is not ſufficient to maintain thoſe great Armies they muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> the reſt of their Proviſions, and all their Ammunition, muſt be brought by a Land-Carriage, with vaſt Labour and Expence; for, to the great Good of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> and all the other conſiderable Rivers, run towards the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> ſo that <hi>Germany</hi> has very rarely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <note place="margin">

great Victories obtained by the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> their King) as to think it is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, or at leaſt equal to <hi>Germany</hi> in Men; yet wiſe men do very well ſee and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the true Reaſons of thoſe great Succeſſes, and that they proceeded neither from the Numbers nor extraordinary Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the <hi>Swedes;</hi> for in the ſpace of Eighteen years, there was not brought over out of <hi>Sweden</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> above Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty thouſand men, the far greateſt part of which returned back again, and yet, during that War, there was ſcarce ever leſs than an Hundred thouſand men of the <hi>Germans</hi> in pay; ſo that the true cauſe of that wonderful Progreſs was the Diſcord of the <hi>Germans,</hi> the opportunity of the Times, which favoured the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and becauſe all the Proteſtants being oppreſſed <note place="margin">☞</note> by the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> looked upon <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> as a Deliverer ſent to them for their Preſervation, from Heaven.

                     <hi>With</hi> France.</note> doubt, whether it be not a Match for <hi>Germany;</hi> and yet if the Forces of both Nations be well conſidered, without their Advantages or Weakneſſes, <hi>(France</hi> being the ſtronger for being a regular Kingdom, and <hi>Germany</hi> the weaker for being a knot of Independent States) <hi>Germany</hi> is certainly the ſtrongeſt of the two; for, 1. It is much greater than <hi>France;</hi> and though we ſhould ſuppoſe it only equal to <hi>France,</hi> in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54100:93"/>
point of Fertility, yet even then it would excell <hi>France</hi> as to its Minerals. 2. It has more Men than <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> have on many occaſions proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the better Souldiers of the two. 3. As to the quantity of Money, it is very difficult to determine on which ſide the Advantage lieth, for it is not to be gueſſed how much Gold the preſent King of <hi>France</hi> has ſqueezed out of the old Horſeleaches of his Kingdom, and how much he has encreaſed his Revenues, which is not to be taken into conſideration without wonder: But then, at the ſame time, it is to be obſerved, that the People of <hi>France</hi> are much more haraſs'd, oppreſs'd, and ruin'd by their exceſſive Taxes, than the People of <hi>Germany</hi> are, and that all the Wealth of <hi>France</hi> runs in one Channel; whereas in <hi>Germany</hi> it is divided amongſt many Princes, and ſo it will not ſo eaſily be computed or eſtimated, as it might if it were paid all into one Prince. <q>[Since <note place="margin">An Addition.</note> this Author wrote, there have been two Wars between <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the ſecond is now depending.

ſo that all their Trade is cut off: The <hi>Germans</hi> have apparently at preſent the Advantage, and it is not denied by the <hi>French,</hi> who do what they can to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Allies one from another; if they fail in this, another Summer may, by God's Bleſſing, ſhew the World, the <hi>German</hi> Nation is much ſuperiour to the <hi>French,</hi> and force that King to diſgorge <hi>Lorrain, Strasburg,</hi> both the <hi>Alſatia</hi>'s, and the <hi>Franche Comte,</hi> which have been got more by Purchace and Surprize, than by the Force of a generous and open War.</q>

cannot think any of them would be ſo mad, as to promote them in it, or lend their Aſſiſtance to it.

Nor would the Pope in this Caſe be over-forward to aſſiſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> becauſe though it would be very glorious to him, and profitable too, to reduce ſo many ſtraying Sheep into the Church's Fold; yet let the hazard or loſs of Souls be what it will, he is not to hazard the loſs of the <hi>Italian</hi> Liberty, by making either the Emperor or the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Maſters of that Country: And if now the <hi>French</hi> ſhould attempt the Conqueſt of <hi>Germany; Spain, England, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> would all unite with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire againſt him; the <hi>Danes</hi> perhaps would not be much concerned at it, ſo be they might be delivered from the Terror of <hi>Sweden,</hi> though they for ever truckled under <hi>France:</hi> But then the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Swedes</hi> would in this caſe be very conſiderable, eſpecially if that Nation happened to have then a Martial and a Warlike Prince. But then it has been long ſince obſerved, that the <hi>French</hi> muſt pay the <hi>Swedes</hi> very well for their aſſiſtance; the <hi>French</hi> would alſo expect to be the only Gainers in the end

And on the other ſide, the <hi>Swedes</hi> are very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how fooliſh it is to ſpend their Bloods to the Advantage of the <hi>French,</hi> and not at all for their own Benefit.

                  </q> The principal Cauſe of this Impuiſſance and Weakneſs is its irregular and ill-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Conſtitution or Frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The moſt numerous multitude of men is not ſtronger than one ſingle man, as long as every man acts ſingly by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and for himſelf; all its extraordinary Strength is from its Union and Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as it is not poſſible that many ſhould join in one natural Body, ſo they may certainly be united into one Force, whilſt they are governed by one Council as a common Soul. By how much the cloſer and more regular this Union is, ſo much the ſtronger this Society or Body is: But on the contrary, Weakneſs and Diſeaſes ever follow upon a looſe Conjunction and an ill-combined and irregular Union. A well compoſed Kingdom or Monarchy is <note place="margin">Monarchy the beſt and moſt laſting Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> certainly the moſt perfect Union, and the beſt fitted for duration or continuance; for as for <hi>Ariſtocraſies,</hi> beſides that, they can ſcarce ever conveniently ſubſiſt, except when the force of a Commonwealth is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54100:97"/>
collected into one ſingle City, yet even then in their own nature they are much weaker than <hi>Monarchies;</hi> for the ſerene Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> is to be reputed amongſt the Miracles of the World. A <hi>Syſtem</hi> of many Cities united by a League, is much more looſe in its conjunction, and may more eaſily be diſſolved, (which is the Caſe of the States of <hi>Holland.)</hi> And <note place="margin">Wherein the Strength of a Syſtem of States conſiſteth.</note> here, that there may be ſome ſtrength in theſe kinds of <hi>Syſtems,</hi> it is in the firſt place neceſſary, that the Aſſociated Cities or States have the ſame form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be not overmuch diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Strength, and that the ſame or equal Advantages may from the Union ariſe to every one of them. And laſtly, It is neceſſary, in this caſe, that they have come together, upon well weighed and great Reaſons, and aſſociated upon well-conſidered Laws or Conditions; for they that unite in a Society raſhly, and as it were in a hurry, without bethinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very ſeriouſly what their future ſtate ſhall be, can no more form a regular well compacted Society, than a Taylor can make a beautiful Garment after he has cut his Cloth all into Shreds and ſmall Pieces, before he has reſolved whether he will form it into a Man's or a Woman's Garment: And it has long ſince been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that <hi>Monarchs</hi> very rarely enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſincere friendſhip with <note n="*" place="margin">The Leagues between Kings and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths ſeldome laſting.</note> 
                  <hi>Commonwealths</hi> or <hi>Free Cities,</hi> though it be for a ſhort time: And it is yet much more difficult
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54100:97"/>
to make a perpetual or laſting League, becauſe all Princes hate Popular Liberty; and the People, or Popular States, do equally deteſt the Pride or Grandeur of Kings. And ſuch is the Perverſeneſs of Humane Nature, that no man doth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſee one inferiour to himſelf in point of Power, live by him in an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Liberty; and Men very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly contribute to the Common Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if they reap nothing, or but a very little Advantage from the Common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>

The outward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and vain Images repreſent the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror as a King, and the States as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and in the moſt ancient times he was without doubt a King, as he was call'd; after this, the Authority of the Emperor was from time to time dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and the Liberties and Riches of the States were encreaſed, till at laſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had nothing but a ſhadow of the Kingly Power, as at this day it is, and ſeems liker the General of an Aſſociation than a King. From hence proceeds a moſt pernicious Convulſion in the Body of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54100:98"/>
Empire, whilſt the Emperor and the States draw counter each to the other; for he, with might and main, by all waies, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth to regain the old Regal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, <note place="margin">The Princes and the Emperor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt each other.</note> and they, on the other ſide, are as ſolicitous to preſerve the Liberties and Wealth they have got the poſſeſſion of; from whence there muſt neceſſarily follow Suſpicious, Diſtruſt, and underhand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances to hinder each others Deſigns, and break each others Power: The firſt effect of this is, the rendering this other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtrong and formidable Body unfit to invade others, or to make any Additions to its own bulk by Conqueſt, becauſe the States are not willing that any thing ſhould be added to the Emperor's Dominions, and yet it is not poſſible to diſtribute it equally amongſt them. And there are <note place="margin">The States em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled one with another.</note> very many diſtracting Differences between the States themſelves, on divers accounts, and this makes them leſs happy than a well united Syſtem of States might be. The States are under different forms of Government, ſome of them being Princes, and the reſt Free Cities, and theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed one with another. The Free Cities drive, for the moſt part, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Trade, and their Wealth excites the Envy of the Princes, but eſpecially when a great part of their Trade and Wealth ariſeth from any of the Princes Dominions. Nor can it be denied, but that ſome Cities, like the <hi>Spleen,</hi> have
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54100:98"/>
ſwell'd too much to the damage of their Neighbour Princes, their Subjects being drained away, and their States impoveriſh'd to augment the Cities. The Nobility are apt to deſpiſe the common People, and they are as prone to value themſelves on the account of their Money, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the Nobilities old Titles and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted Dominions. Laſtly, Some of the Princes look on theſe Cities as a reproach to their Government, and think their own Subjects would live more contentedly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Command, if theſe Inſtances of Popular Liberty were removed, and all occaſions of comparing their own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that of their Neighbours in theſe Cities were taken away. From hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Envy, Contemt, Mutual Inſults, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious, ſecret Contrivances againſt each other, all which Miſchiefs are yet more manifeſt, and outragiouſly proſecuted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Biſhops and the Cities in which the Cathedral Churches are fixed: Yea, in the Diets the Princes do ever expreſs a great Contemt of the Cities, but the Emperor, on the contrary, doth alwaies cheriſh and protect them, becauſe he finds them more obſervant of his Orders than the other States. Nor do the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bear that mutual kindneſs each to other they ought, eſpecially the <hi>Secular</hi> and the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Princes;</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> have the Preheminence or Precedence of the <hi>Temporal,</hi> on the account of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54100:99"/>
Sanctity of their Office, and alſo becauſe their great Experience in the World and Learning is ſuppoſed to make them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able than the Laymen to adviſe, which in the barbarous times begat them a great Authority in the State. But then the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Princes</hi> are now very much concerned to ſee theſe Prelates, which are for the moſt part the Sons of meaner Families than themſelves, in a few years time equal, yea, and mount above them, as if they had more of the <hi>Grace of God than themſelves.</hi> They are yet more aggrieved, becauſe theſe men cannot tranſmit their Eſtates to their Poſterity, but their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies continue in the ſame eſtate it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but that many of theſe Holy Fathers have learned from the Pope to enrich their Kindred by Eccleſiaſtical Benefices and large Donations, out of the Revenues of the Church: On the other ſide, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have more reaſon to be offended with the Temporal Princes, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted and cut off ſo many of their old Preferments; of which I ſhall ſay more hereafter. Beſides all theſe that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, the Inequality of their Eſtates and Riches is another Fountain of Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent betwixt them: For firſt, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the more potent contemn the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and are but too apt to oppreſs them; and the weaker are as ready to complain and ſuſpect, and ſometimes to boaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably, that they are equally free with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54100:99"/>
the moſt powerful. The very exalting the <hi>Electors</hi> above the other Princes, is a great cauſe of Diſcontent; whilſt the other States are diſpleaſed at their Dignity, and charge them with uſurping ſome things they have no Right to; and the <hi>Electors</hi> as ſtifly maintain what they have got as their Right and Due.</p>

Nor is the diverſity of Opinions and the commonly practiſed, excluding each other out of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (as Prieſts of diverſe and contrary Opinions uſe to do) the only cauſe of their mutual hating each other: The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> charge the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> That they have deprived them of a great part of their Wealth and Riches, and they (good men) are night and day contriving how they ſhall recover what they have thus loſt; and the other Party are as well reſolved to keep what they have got: Nay, they think they have ſtill too much, and that the Revenues of the Church, at this day, are a Burthen to the State, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prieſts and Monks depend upon another Head, who is no part of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> but a Foreigner, and an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

It will be enough for us here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to touch the principal of theſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> has raiſed a Spirit of Jealouſie and Envy in all the other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> by its long Poſſeſſion of the Imperial Dignity, and the vaſt Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions it has by that means acquired in the Empire and elſewhere: Beſides the old Quarrel between the Houſes of the Elector
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54100:101"/>
                  <hi>Palatine</hi> and that of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> there is a new one concerning the <hi>Adminiſtration of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs during the Vacancy of the Empire,</hi> which will hardly be determin'd, the one Houſe relying on its Power, and the other on its Right. In the Houſe of <hi>Saxony</hi> there is a Conteſt and Heart-burning between the Lines of <hi>Erneſt</hi> and <hi>Albert,</hi> becauſe the former ſtripp'd the latter of the Electoral Dignity, in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> V. The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> will never forgive the <hi>Swedes,</hi> for their uſurping from him the beſt part of <hi>Pomerania.</hi> The Elector <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> is hated by many of his Neighbours, on the account of ſome diſputed Rights he claims in their Territories, ſo that very lately they were for Arming againſt him to recover them. And I cannot believe the memory of that old Controverſie is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed wholly, which embroiled the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> with that of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> for the Territory of <hi>Marpurg.</hi> Nor will there ever be a ſincere Friendſhip between the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Newburg,</hi> (which, ſince our Author wrote, has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Electroate of the <hi>Lower Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> of the <hi>Rhine)</hi> on the account of the Inheritance of the Dukedom of <hi>Juliers.</hi> Who can number now the ſmaller Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies depending between them?

Politick Body we may add (although of leſs conſequence) the tedious Proceedings in all Civil Cauſes, by which the moſt manifeſt and apparent Right is diſputed and deluded for many years: And the great variety of Monies which is current in <hi>Germany,</hi> which being neither of good allay or due weight, brings great damage to the Commerce or Trade of <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſinks the value of the Eſtates of private men very ſenſibly. But then we are to aſcribe the Luxury of ſome of our Princes, who being too much addicted to Hunting, take little or no care of their Eſtates and Subjects, more to the Men than to the Form of that State; and we muſt grant, other States are as liable as <hi>Germany</hi> to theſe kinds of Miſcarriages, and we ſee them ſuffer as much by it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Suppoſe by this time it is ſufficiently <note place="margin">The Remedies of theſe Diſeaſes enquired into.</note> ſhewn, how many and great the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of <hi>Germany</hi> are; to aſſign the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is a Work of greater difficulty, and which will not become a Stranger and a Traveller.

But before I diſcover my mind in this Affair, I think it is fit to conſider the Remedies propoſed by <hi>Hippolithus à Lapide,</hi> for the Cure of the <hi>German</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities; for though many men have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired his Preſcriptions, yet I have ever thought they were ill contrived, and not likely to contribute to her Cure.</p>

2. In the firſt place he preſcribes Six Laws, which he calls the Intereſt of ſuch <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Remedies of</hi> Hyppolithus à Lapide <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</hi>
                  </note> a State, and ſaith, They ought carefully to be obſerved in a State like to that of <hi>Germany,</hi> that is, in an <hi>Ariſtocraſie,</hi> where the Supreme Soveraign Power is in the States, or great men, and nothing left to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, but the Pomps and Images of a King: So (ſaid he) they ought, 1. To ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Six Rules by him preſcribed to the Princes of</hi> Germany.</note> the waies and means of Concord, and to avoid Factions. 2. Not to ſuffer the Imperial Dignity to continue long in any one Family, leſt by the long uſe of theſe Pomps and Images, a deſire of acquiring a ſolid and real Soveraignty ſhould grow up in them. 3. Though the Power of directing and moderating the Offices of all the Parts to the Common Good is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon a Prince or Single Perſon, for the greater union of the Commonwealth; yet the Nobility ought alwaies to keep the Stern of the State in their own hands, and the Power of directing and ordering the things of great moment, to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the Diet, which ought to convene frequently; or at leaſt they ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome Senate or Counſel, which ſhall be perpetual; which kind of Regiment was in uſe in the beginning of the laſt Age before this. 4. That nothing but the Enſigns of Royalty be left to the Prince, but that the Regal Juriſdiction and Power be reſerved entire to the Commonwealth. 5. That neither the Life, Fortunes, or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54100:103"/>
Fames of any of the Princes be truſted to the ſingle Juſtice or Diſcretion of the Emperor. 6. That neither the Army, Militia, or Forts, be under his ſingle Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction or Government. After this he takes great pains to ſhew in how many particulars theſe Laws are violated by the Emperor, and ſome of the States them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being very ſharp in his Reflections on the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and on ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Electors. Now, though theſe Laws were not wholly to be deſpiſed, yet ſeeing I have above ſufficiently proved, that <hi>Germany</hi> is no <hi>Ariſtocraſie,</hi> it is a folly to think the Safety of <hi>Germany</hi> is only to be found in the obſervation of theſe Laws.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſame Author preſcribes Six Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies <note place="margin">Six Remedies preſcribed by that Author rejected.</note> for the curing all the Diſeaſes of <hi>Germany.</hi> 1. He recommends the Study of Concord, and a General Pardon, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all Grievances by which mutual Hatreds are kept alive and nouriſhed in the minds of the Princes againſt each other; and that they ſhould not divide into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the account of Religion, and for that cauſe neglect the Publick Safety. This Remedy affords a Copious Subject for a Scholaſtick Declamation, but can never be applied to the uſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> till all the Nobility of that Nation happen to be wiſe and good, and to govern the Motions of their Minds by Rules of Philoſophy. 2. In the next place, he would have the Houſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54100:103"/>
of <hi>Auſtria</hi> extirpated, and their Eſtates brought into the Common Treaſury. Now this is the Advice of a Hangman, and not of a Phyſician<hi>:</hi> As if every one that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to be a little too rich, for his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's advantage, were preſently to be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and deſtroyed from off the face of the Earth: But ſuppoſe we ſhould obey the Tyrannical Law, who will dare to lay the Ax to the Root of a Tree, which has ſpread its Branches over ſo many Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that it is not for the Intereſt of <hi>Europe</hi> to have all its Territories added to thoſe of any one or two other Princes? Beſides, a part of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> are heartily united in their Intereſt and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to this Houſe; a great many of the reſt neither love nor hate it; and the reſt of the Princes, when united, are not able to overthrow that vaſt Fabrick. They muſt then call Foreigners to their aſſiſtance, and who, I pray, but the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swedes?</hi> For when <hi>Hippolithus</hi> wrote this Book, thoſe Nations were zealouſly at work to do this, and the Ignorant much applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, becauſe they craftily pretended to defend the <hi>German</hi> Liberty, which was oppreſs'd by the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> But was it civil to expect they ſhould take ſo much Pains, and ſpend ſo many Men, and ſo much Money for nothing? Nor was there to be found any Lord Treaſurer, who would faithfully bring this Prey into the Treaſury; wiſe men more rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54100:104"/>
that if they had proſpered in their undertakings againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> would have been forced to take up the old Complaint of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Froggs, who inſtead of a <hi>Block</hi> had got a <hi>Stork</hi> for their <hi>King:</hi> And when the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had been ruined, <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> muſt have had an Head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Author would have another Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror elected, whom from his common Place-book he adorns with the attendance and ſplendor of all the Virtues, only that he might be truſted with an empty Title, being deſtitute of all Regal Power, and appointed to be a meer Director and a Magiſtrate. Now, there may be ſome uſe of ſuch a Preſident or Director in ſome <hi>Ariſtocratick</hi> City, where the Nobility all live within the Walls of the ſame Town: But as for <hi>Germany,</hi> if he would have ſpoke his mind out, he ought to have ſaid, that it has no need of any Emperor. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, after all, has taken care to add as much to the Exchequer of his Emperor, as he has taken from his Power. It was great pity ſo great a Prince, ſo virtuous a Man, ſhould live in want. But yet the Dominions of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> were to be employed as the Patrimony of the Empire, and if this was not ſufficient, then he would needs have the Electors reſtore what had been given them by <hi>Charles</hi> IV. But in the mean time, this Learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſeems to know nothing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54100:104"/>
and temper of Mankind, who thinks that a Prince who is poſſeſſed of ſo much Power as theſe are, will in the turn of an Hand be contentedly reduced to the ſtate of a private Gentleman; and when the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> is once dead and buried, theſe Electors will be much leſs diſpoſed to part with what they have poſſeſſed above 300 years; for beſides that, Princes are ſo dull, that they cannot poſſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Doctrine of their Confeſſors, when they prate to them about reſtoring ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Eſtates; the Electors have here ſomething to ſay for themſelves againſt all the other States; for I will ſuppoſe that very many of them muſt return to very mean Cottages or Country-houſes, if they be equally bound to give an exact account how they and their Anceſtors got what they now enjoy; and therefore 'tis but juſt, that all men ſhould poſſeſs what they and their Predeceſſors have a long time poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. In the 4th. place, <hi>Hippolitus</hi> would have a mutual Confidence reſtored amongſt the States and Princes, and all Diſtruſt era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated; which, he ſuppoſeth, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow, if all Grievances and Injuries were taken away by a friendly Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he thinks the greateſt part of theſe Jealouſies have ariſen from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religions profeſſed in the Empire. Now, when theſe things had been conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the firſt Article, what need was there to repeat them here? What he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54100:105"/>
further ſaith of ſettling the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of taking away the Chamber at <hi>Vienna,</hi> of maintaining a conſiderable Army in perpetual Pay, of ſettling a Revenue for the Army and War, of employing the Annats to that purpoſe, ſhall all of them be conſidered in the following Sections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is time now to produce our own <note place="margin">The Author's own Remedies propoſed.</note> Remedies, that it may be tried, whether we are more fortunate in diſcovering what may abate the <hi>German</hi> Feaver, and pleaſe them too at the ſame time. I know prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Advice is ſeldom well reſented, and wiſe men would never counſel any man to offer unasked Remedies to thoſe that are ſick, becauſe they that are invited and hired too for that purpoſe, are often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to endure the Reproaches of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Patients. Private men do very rarely meet with any other Reward than that of Contempt and Scorn, when they preſume to give Advice to thoſe that govern others; beſides, they will ever pretend, when the Diſeaſe is once found out, it is very eaſie to diſcover the Cure alſo. Yet after all, leſt this ſmall Piece ſhould end abruptly and imperfectly, I will here ſubjoin a few things; I lay this as a Foundation to all I ſhall propoſe, <hi>viz. That the depraved ſtate of</hi> Germany <hi>is become ſo inveterate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs, that it cannot be reduced back to the ſtate of a Regular Monarchy, without the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ruin of the Nation and Government.</hi> But then, ſeeing it comes very near to the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54100:105"/>
ſtate of a <hi>Syſtem of ſeveral Independent States</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>united by a League or Confederacy,</hi> the ſafeſt courſe it can poſſibly take, is to follow thoſe methods which the Writers of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks have preſcribed for the well-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Societies, the firſt of which is, That they ſhould rather be ſollicitous to preſerve their own, than think of taking any thing from their Neighbors. Their next greateſt care is to preſerve Peace at home; and to that end it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to preſerve every one in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his own Rights, and not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any of the ſtronger Princes to oppreſs any of the weaker, that ſo, though they are, as to other things, not equal, yet in the point of Liberty they may be all equal each to other, and alike ſecured; that all old out-dated Pretences ſhould be buried in eternal forgetfulneſs, and every one for the future be ſuffered quietly to enjoy what he now poſſeſſeth. That all new Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which may happen to ariſe, ſhould be referr'd to the Arbitrement of the other Alies in the League, who are neither by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Love nor Hatred; and thoſe that refuſed to ſubmit to their Judgment, ſhould be compell'd to do it by all the reſt of the Confederates; and if it be thought fit to appoint a Prince over this Syſtem, great care muſt be taken, that he doth not take into his Hands, or pretend at leaſt to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> direct Soveraignty over them. That the beſt way to prevent this, is to take care
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54100:106"/>
that neither the ſtrong places nor the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery may depend on that Prince. That he is not only to be bounded by certain and accurate Laws in his Adminiſtration, but a perpetual Council to be aſſigned him, which may repreſent the States, and govern thoſe Affairs with him, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day happen in the Adminiſtration of the Publick Affairs, according to the Laws enacted in the Diets. That all Foreign Affairs, which concern the whole Body of the Empire, ſhould be likewiſe committed to this Council, who ſhall give an account of them to their Principals, that at laſt they may be determined by the general Conſent of all the Parties; and when any difficult Affairs ariſe, let this Council have a Power to ſummon extraordinary Diets, which to the end they may be held with the leſs expences, and diſpatch buſineſs the more quickly, there ought to be a new and more certain form of Proceedings thought of: But then it doth not ſeem very probable, that the Family of <hi>Auſtria</hi> will ſuffer ſuch a Council to be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, becauſe they will ever labour to keep their Power above controul. Nor will the <note place="margin">The Empire cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to another Family.</note> Preſent State of <hi>Germany</hi> permit the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Imperial Dignity into another Houſe, as long as there is any Male in that of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> therefore their Modeſty is to be wrought on, to perſwade them to be content with their preſent Grandeur, and not to labour to eſtabliſh a Soveraign
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54100:106"/>
Authority over the reſt of the States and Princes; and it will become the Princes manfully, and with united Hands and Hearts, to oppoſe and reſiſt all ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, which tend to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and in the firſt place, to take care that none may league with one another, or with the Princes of the Empire, againſt any of the Members of it; and if they do ſo, to render all ſuch Combinations inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; and if any Princes have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with each other, to take all the Care is poſſible, that <hi>Germany</hi> may not be by that means involved in a War: But in the firſt place, Care ought to be taken, that Foreigners may not intermeddle with the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> nor poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the leaſt Particle of it; to that end all waies that are poſſible are to be conſidered, that they that border on <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> may not have the opportunity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their Kingdoms which they ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately deſire, by raviſhing its Provinces from it one after another, till their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, like a <hi>Gangreen,</hi> creep into the very Bowels of the Empire. If any thing of this nature happen to be attempted, let <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> preſently take the Alarm, provide her Defences, and ſeek the Alliance and Aſſiſtance of thoſe whoſe Intereſt it is to keep any one Kingdom from mounting to too great and exorbitant a Power; and then, as long as <hi>Germany</hi> is contented with the defending what is her own, ſhe will

have no need to maintain any very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Armies, yet ſhe ought in due time to concert the Numbers that every one ſhall ſend, in caſe of neceſſity: And <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> may, from her Neighbour the <hi>Swedes,</hi> learn the methods of maintaining an Army in the times of Peace with ſmall Expence, which yet ſhall be ready when occaſion ſerves, at ſhort warning, to draw into the Field for her defence.</p>

where I had lately been, there was no ſuch thing, and yet there men had the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt liberty to think and believe as they themſelves pleaſed, for there every man was intent upon his own Trade and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not at all concern'd of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion his Neighbour was. Upon this an Illuſtrious Perſon, who had ſpent a great part of his Life in the Courts of ſeveral Princes, but was now retired to live a very private life, begged the <hi>Nunci<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o</hi>'s Leave to ſpeak his own mind freely, which being granted: <q>Since (ſaid he) that travelling Gentleman has mentioned a thing I have very long and ſeriouſly thought on, I will now diſcover what I take to be the moſt probable cauſe of this thing, we being now at good leiſure, and I am well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to approve my own former Thoughts on this Affair, if your <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> ſhould happen to diſlike them. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this beginning, at a diſtance from our preſent times, he ſhewed how many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies had, from the beginning, afflicted and diſtracted the Church of Chriſt, the greateſt part of which, in proceſs of time, vaniſhed of their own accord; but then there had hardly happened any <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that had ſpread ſo far, and ruin'd ſo many private Families and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms as this, which in the laſt Century aroſe here in <hi>Germany,</hi> and was occaſion'd by ſome few Doctors of that Nation: There were great Wits on both ſides, and

they contended againſt each other with the moſt furious Paſſions, and to this day there is not the leaſt hope of putting an end to this Quarrel.

The Power they aſcribe to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the governing Religion, is indeed not ſo favourable to the exceſſive Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Prieſts; ſo where it has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, their Wealth is little, but the Commonwealth has the benefit of that Abatement: The People are taught by them to reverence their Magiſtrates and Princes, as the Miniſters of God, and that all the good works expected from them, is to do the Duties of Good men: Nor am I diſpleaſed, that they have retained ſo much of the Ceremonial Part and the Pomp of Religion, which ſerves to divert the minds of the People, who have not ſence enough to contemplate the Beauty of ſimple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd Piety: So that though their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Myſteries are not adorned to the frightful height of Superſtition, yet they are in a decent and grave Dreſs, and ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to teach Mankind, that the Divine Wiſdom and Power is able to effect that which we are not able throughly to comprehend; the very Ruſticity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that appears in the Profeſſors of that Religion, and which is ſo much bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſome, is to me a ſign and a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Sincerity and Uprightneſs: So that as it is not poſſible to imagine a Religion that can be more ſerviceable and uſeful to the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> than that of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> we may from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this is the beſt for a <hi>Monarchy</hi> of any in the World.

been the Duty of the Princes, by degrees to have laid theſe Controverſies aſleep, not by violent methods, (which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exaſperate Diſſenters) but by oblique ways and Artifice: For if Princes, in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Miniſters, would for the future not regard the Names of Mens Parties, but the Abilities and Endowments of their Minds; and if the Subjects were inured to bear an equal regard to both the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; if the Miniſters were forbidden all Diſputes in their Sermons, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anger the oppoſite ſide by ſharp Reflections; and none were ſuffered to teach in the Schools but moderate and prudent men, I doubt not but, in a few years, all theſe Debates would end of themſelves: But I believe, at the ſame time, he would deſerve very ill of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſhould give this Advice to her Enemies.</q> [And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <note place="margin">An Addition.</note> this Advice would certainly end in the ruin of the Reformation in <hi>Germany;</hi> for by that time any Pariſh had been <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> and <hi>Calviniſt</hi> in their Worſhip by turns, two or three times backward and forward, as the Miniſters changed, they would care for neither of them, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and hate each other mortally; ſome would perſiſt in one way, and others in the other, and the major part would think this fickle unconſtancy in Religion an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the uncertainty of it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever enquiring which were the beſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

And in truth, I have a great while admired the Folly of our Prieſts, in pretending to decide the Controverſies depending between them and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, by the Sacred Scriptures, when they might have taken another courſe, that for certainty and plainneſs would have been equal to a Mathematical Propoſition: For if, according to the Uſe and Cuſtom of

the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the great deſign and principal end of all Religion be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Riches and Authority of the Prieſts, our Adverſaries are mad if ever they write one word more in a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie that has ſpent ſuch innumerable number of Tuns of Paper, to no purpoſe. For example ſake, let us propoſe a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It is pretended the Sacred Scriptures are very obſcure, and all Laymen are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to read them on that pretence, that ſo the Prieſts may have the ſole Power of interpreting them, and that the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may not from thence pick out any thing that ſhall be contrary to the Prieſts Intereſt. <hi>Traditions</hi> are added to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, that if any thing has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be omitted in the Scriptures, which is neceſſary to the former great Deſign, it may from thence be convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplied: Nay, that whole Religion is adorned with ſo many gaudy Ceremonies, that the Splendor and Pomp of them, as well as the exceſſive number, may amuſe the Minds of the common People, that like men in an amazement and wonder, they may never ſo much as think on ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Piety. To leave the remiſſion and forgiveneſs of Sin only to God, were a thing that would yield no profit to the Prieſt, and therefore the Prieſts challenge that, and know wondrouſly well how to improve it to the beſt advantage, for they will not diſpenſe ſo profitable and gainful
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54100:112"/>
an Office, upon a general Confeſſion, to a whole Congregation at once, and then be contented with ſome mean Preſent or Salary, as the Parties concerned ſhall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give: No, they have taken order there ſhall be an exact Enumeration of Sins, and the Taxing them is then left to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Prieſt; and now, if the Party confeſſing is rich, Paradiſe will go at a good price, though the Sins be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remitted, as they pretend; for, Who can be ſo hard-hearted, as not to give liberally to ſo good a Father? And if the Party is poor, then the Prieſt will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Ghoſtly Authority with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeverity. And in the mean time, what a vaſt Advantage it is to the Church and Clergy to know all mens Secrets? And who would not revere the Maſter of his Soul and Heart? And in ſhort, the Wit of Man can never invent a thing that ſhall turn more to the Gain and Authority of the Prieſts than the <hi>Maſs;</hi> for, Who can deny the man that performs this ſaving Office a good Reward? And who can forbear worſhipping him that can by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret whiſper produce ſo venerable a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim or Sacrifice? It is fit to deny the Laity the uſe of the Cup to the utmoſt extremity, that they may think the Church never did, or can err. The number of the Sacraments was not encreaſed for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to the intent men might the oftner need the aſſiſtance of their Prieſts.

Who can tell what profit the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts have drawn from Matrimonial Caſes, all which have been brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their cognizance, only on the pretence Marriage was a Sacrament? Yet one would think married men ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all theſe Caſes full as well as they. The vaſt Force they aſcribe to the Merit of Good Works, as it excites, like a Spur, the ambitious and vain-glorious Piety of Men; ſo on the other hand, they have craftily taken care to give us ſuch a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Good Works, as for the moſt part tends to the enriching of the Clergy, and doth moſt incomparably well agree with the reſt of their Theological Syſtem. Not can I think the Fire of <hi>Purgatory</hi> was kindled for any other purpoſe, but only to lay, on that pretence, a Tax upon thoſe who by Death had eſcaped all other Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, (and to make the ſeparate Souls a Merchandable Commodity, which was never dreamt on before.) The Invocation of Saints encreaſeth very much the Gaity of their Religion, and the Authority of their Clergy, who by their Vote advance whom they pleaſe to be Nobles in the Court of Heaven. To add more to thoſe who ſo well know them, were troubleſome and needleſs; and in truth, whoever tries the whole by this Rule, will ſee this was the only thing that all is levell'd at. The <hi>Hierarchy</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Commonwealth</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> as they have ordered it, is a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54100:113"/>
wonderful artificial Contrivance, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, ſo knit, cloſed, and fixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I think I may truly ſay, ſince the Creation of the World, there never was any Politick Body ſo well formed and diſpoſed, and which had ſuch ſtrong Foundations as this has; for it is form'd into a moſt exact Monarchy; and the King of the Prieſts has an Authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him equal to that of God. This <hi>Vicar</hi> of God cannot err; and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth the Function of a Turn-key to the Gates of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> with an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority above controul, and from which there lies no Appeal. And in the better and more fortunate Ages of this Church, it was moſt firmly believed too, that this King was the Diſpoſer of all Kingdoms; that he could depoſe Kings, and ſet others up in their ſteads; but now, alas! the new Doctors have ſo traduced this moſt uſeful Doctrin, that it is become hateful and invidious to the very Catholick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves, and they are fain, in ſome Kingdoms, to deny they ever taught any ſuch thing: And becauſe the Majeſty of this King depends only on the Opinion of his Sanctity, they have wiſely contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it ſhould paſs by Election, for fear this Royal Blood ſhould degenerate, and that this Throne may ever be filled with a perſon free from the defects of Youth, and to the end he might be more intent upon the Good of the Church,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54100:114"/>
than the enriching his Family. For this laſt reaſon they have denied Marriage to all the Members of this Society (the Prieſts and Clergy) that their Family-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns might not divert them, (or Wife and Children make them ſubject to the Wills of their Princes.) The multitude and variety of their Religious Orders is very great, that there might be many in every place, to take care of their Affairs, and ſpread their Nets, and bait their Hooks to catch the Eſtates and Goods of the Laity. Nor has any Temporal Prince in the whole World ſo great and profound a Reſpect and Obedience paid to him by all his Subjects, as this Eccleſiaſtick Monarch; and although there are many furious Emulations between his Subjects, yet the <hi>Pope</hi> wiſely takes ſuch care to <note place="margin">The reaſon of inventing the Jeſuits Order.</note> moderate and govern them, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring any Damage or Diſturbance to his Kingdom. Thus all the old Orders look very diſcontentedly on the new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> becauſe it has much abated the Eſteem they enjoy'd before; for after this wanton Age would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be bridled by the ſimple ignorant Sanctity of the Monks, that holy Society was invented, to the great good of the Church, which at firſt with great Art ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this falling Fabrick, by undertaking the Inſtruction of Youth, Confeſſion of Penitents, and a cunning Scrutiny into the Secrets of all men. So that many think
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54100:114"/>
all that <hi>Job</hi> hath ſaid of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> may, in a myſtick ſence, be very aptly applied to this Prieſtly Empire: No doubt can reaſonably be made however, that the Religion is the very beſt of all others which heaps moſt Riches and Honours on all its Votaries, and is furniſhed with the beſt means of ſhearing the Sheep to the very Skin, and at the ſame time keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as quiet, and more obedient than thoſe that have all their Wool left on them to keep them warm. I think by this time I have ſufficiently proved, that they have hitherto managed the Diſputes between the Catholicks and the new Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers very ignorantly; for theſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have ranged their Antagoniſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Hereticks, and raiſed brutiſh Cries againſt them in all places, that they ought to be extirpated by Fire and Sword, by which they have made all ſincere and hearty reconciliation deſperate and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. This has again forced the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to take the utmoſt care for their own ſafety and ſecurity; and when they had once poſſeſſed the Laity with a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the Prieſts Sanctity, it was a very eaſie ſtep, by ſhewing them the Prieſts Wealth would be their reward, to draw them on their ſide, and engage them to be their Defenders: But if at firſt their Brains had lain right, there might have been means found out to have ſweetned the Minds of the Laity, before they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54100:115"/>
that ſide; and that ſmall <hi>Saxon Monk (Luther)</hi> might more eaſily have been won to a reconciliation with the <hi>Pope,</hi> by preſenting him with a good fat Benefice, than by all the Thunders of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> the force of which, by the diſtance of the place, and the coldneſs of the <hi>German</hi> Air, was ſo much abated, that by that time it reached the Monk, the noiſe, the heat, and the terror of it was wholly loſt. And on the other ſide we cannot enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the folly of the modern Proteſtant Doctors, that they ſhould, without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perſwade thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to leave their preſent ſtate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all their vaſt Wealth, and to come over to them, that they may there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the mean condition of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar people, and work hard for a Living, or ſtarve: For they have ſome reaſon for what they ſay, when they offer the Lay-people more Liberty, and the Princes the Spoils of the Prieſts. Yet to give the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> their due; after the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the firſt Defection, and the Heat of the firſt Reformers was abated, they recollected the Remains of their broken Forces with all the Induſtry and Care that was poſſible; and they have ever ſince managed their affairs with more order and ſubtilty than the Reformed have theirs; for, to the beſt of my remembrance, in this preſent Century none of our <hi>Roman Catholick Princes</hi> have become <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>

That it was alſo fit, that Churches ſhould be built on the publick charge, whoſe external beauty and magnificence might create in the Minds of Men an awful regard to Religion, for the kindling the Devotion of the Common People. But then I think no wiſe man will deny, that thoſe men who are no way neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Service of God nor employed in his Worſhip, ought not to be called or thought Churchmen, or of the Clergy, and that what was employed in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch men, has nothing of Sanctity in it. But in <hi>Germany</hi> the Clergy were ſo vaſtly enriched by the liberality of the old Emperors, the Princes, and the Common People, that one half, if not more, of the <hi>Lands</hi> of that <hi>Nation</hi> was in their hands, which was never heard of in any other; and an innumerable ſhole of lazy uſeleſs men made it their buſineſs to live upon and devour this vaſt Wealth; which was neither agreeable to the Rules of the Chriſtian Religion, nor of ſound Policy. The Holy Scriptures do indeed command as to provide decently and liberally for
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54100:116"/>
the Clergy, and that we ſhould not muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn; but then they never give that name to thoſe who have no ſhare in the Miniſtry of the Church: Nor do they any where exempt the Perſons of the Clergy, or their Revenues, from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Civil Magiſtrate, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to attemperate the ſame in ſuch manner as may be conſiſtent with the Publick Good. And your <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>The Author pretends to be a</hi> Venetian.</note> 
                     <hi>Venetian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick underſtands none better, that the Revenues and Riches of the Church are not to be exceſſively encreaſed to the damage of the State, and ſhe has accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly wiſely put a ſtop to that leak, the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> oppoſing her in this Deſign in vain, and without any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. In truth, ſhe ſaw her ſelf waſted by this means, and as it were brought into a Conſumption, whilſt her Riches and Lands were engroſſed by a ſort of men who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no Authority but that of an Head without their State, and pretended at the ſame time they were exempted by the Divine Laws from contributing to the publick Burthens. As to the number of Biſhops, <hi>Germany</hi> has no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, except that, conſidering the extent of the Nation, they are too few to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Office as they ought, if they were otherwiſe well diſpoſed to do it: But to what purpoſe ſerves the vaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues belonging to theſe few Sees? You
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54100:117"/>
will perhaps ſay they are Princes of the Empire, as well as Biſhops, and take their ſhare in the Care of the State with the other Princes: Why then let them abſtain from the Sacred Title of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> becauſe that holy Office is inconſiſtent with the vaſt burthen of ſecular buſineſs, which is neceſſarily attending on the Office of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prince; let them lay by the firſt, and ſtick wholly to the laſt Title; for I think the Chriſtian Religion would ſuffer no detriment if they did not celebrate one or two Maſſes in a year, attended with a vaſt number of their Guards and Retinue in rich Garbs, and with great pomp, as if they deſigned nothing by it but to reproach the Poverty and mean Circumſtances of the firſt ſettlers of the Chriſtian Religion. So let the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> (if he will) poſſeſs his great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, to enable him to ſuſtain the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Charge of his Office of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Germany;</hi> but then there is no apparent cauſe can be given why he ſhould have a Biſhop's See aſſigned to him, when the other Princes of the Empire, who have as great zeal for the welfare of their Country as he, have been contented to take none but Temporal Titles. Now what ſhall I ſay of the Canons of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches, which are the Blocks they hew into Biſhops? They perform none of the Sacred Offices; and this they are not aſhamed to own to all the World,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54100:117"/>
by calling themſelves <hi>Irregular Canous,</hi> and they too, to ſpare their own precious Lungs, fill their Churches with Noiſes, made by their mercenary Curates; and ſuch of them as are not employed in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs, are meer uſeleſs Burthens of the Earth, ſerving their Bellies and their Luſts. Now as to thoſe that are wholly employed in Worldly Concerns, why are they called Holy men? Why are they maintained by the Revenues of the Church? And what ſhall I ſay of the exceſſive Riches of the Monaſteries, and of the wonderful ſwarms of ſhaven Crowns that hover about them? It is certainly neceſſary, that there ſhould be Colleges for the ſitting your Youth for the Service of the Church and State; and I ſhould be well pleaſed to ſuffer ſome few men to ſpend all their daies in them too, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Contemplation, for which only Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has fitted them; and beſides, if they were brought on the ſtage, the world would loſe the benefit of thoſe advantages it might reap from their Studies; ſo that, as to theſe men, the State would have no great reaſon to complain, becauſe at one time or other they would recompence the Charges of maintaining them with good Intereſt: yet then both theſe ſorts of men are moſt happy, when they have ſober and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Proviſions made for them; over-great ones load them with fat, which ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles and obſtructs both their <hi>Vigour</hi> and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54100:118"/>
                     <hi>Induſtry.</hi> But then there doth not ſeem to be any good Reaſon that can poſſibly be given by the Wit of Man, why the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſhould be at the charge of fatting up a vaſt number of lubbarly lazy fellows, who have betaken themſelves to their ugly Cowles out of pure deſperation, and are good for nothing but to fill the Church with ſenſleſs noiſes, or Prayers repeated with ſuch cold and unconcerned affections, that they are fain to keep the account of them by their Beads. The only pretence worth the regarding, that is made for the exceſſive Riches of the Church, is,</q> 
                  <hi>That the illuſtrious and noble Families of</hi> Germany <hi>have a means to provide for their younger Children, who being promoted to Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, are kept from being a Burthen to their own Families, by which means Eſtates are kept from being crumbled into ſmall Particles, by dividing and ſubdividing them in every Deſcent, and the Riches and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of Families is upholden, nay, ſometimes encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the younger Brother, who muſt otherwiſe have ſtruggled with Want and Penury at home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanced to conſiderable and rich Dignities in the Church.</hi> 
                  <q>And I confeſs it was a good Fetch and a crafty Policy in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thus to chain the nobleſt Families to her Intereſt, and purchaſe their Favour. But then, though it is worth our care to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how we may preſerve the Families of our Nobility and Gentry; yet in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, they that firſt gave theſe Lands to the Church never dreamt of any ſuch thing,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54100:118"/>
and it is moſt certain this has nothing of Religion in it. And as to theſe younger Children, if they are men of ſpirit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they have other means enough to raiſe their Fortunes, and improve their Eſtates and Reputations at home or abroad, in times of Peace or War: But then, if they are uſeful to no body in neither of theſe, it were fit to make them underſtand they cannot reaſonably expect their Sloth ſhould be rewarded with an Entertainment at the Charge of the Publick, in the ſame manner the <hi>Athenians</hi> did their moſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Citizens. If they will ſtill inſiſt, that at leaſt, by this means, the over-great number of the Nobility is kept from becoming contemptible by their poverty; I reply, That if they are men of truly noble Endowments, their multitude can bring no diſhonour or diſeſteem to their Order, or to the State, becauſe Virtue can never want a Station and a ſuitable Reward: But then, if they fear they ſhould fill the World with a degenerate Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity worſe than themſelves. I think this is true, and they ought to be kept from Marriage, that they may not ſtock the World with uſeleſs Drones: But then others, that are not in Holy Orders, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the uſe of Women: But if they will not do that, I think the good old men, who gave theſe Lands to the Church, out of a belief, that whilſt they leſſened the Inheritances of their Children,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54100:119"/>
they promoted the Glory of God, and the Salvation of their Souls, are now miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably abuſed in their Graves, to have them now conſigned only to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a parcel of publick Stalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">
                  <q>10. This being however the truth of <note place="margin">The Proteſtant Princes fairly vindicated.</note> the caſe, I for my part think the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes</hi> will be able to give a very good and rational account to God and all wiſe men, why they have taken that care they have to employ the Revenues of the Church, which lay within their Dominions, and ſo was properly under their Juriſdictions, to the education of Youth in Piety and good Arts, and to the maintenance of ſuch Miniſters as were truly and in good earneſt employed in the Service of God, and what was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, to the Service of the State; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before the whole was ſpent in Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Sloth. And if the Emperor and the reſt of the Catholick Princes had taken the ſame care in their States, they had disburthened <hi>Germany</hi> of a number of ill Humours, which now oppreſs it. Nor could the Pope have reſented it without ſhewing himſelf openly more a Friend to the Vices of the Times than is conſiſtent with his Honour. Nor was there any neceſſity that they ſhould have ever the more changed their Faith in other particulars, though they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched the number of their Clergy, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54100:119"/>
reduced their Revenues to a narrower Scantling, for the publick good of their States; for their Chriſtian Anceſtors find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poverty and Piety united in their days, long before the Priviledges of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> were thought of, agreed with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in matters of Faith. The greateſt difficulty, as ſome thought, lay in the Biſhopricks, which are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, becauſe it was not for the Intereſt of <hi>Germany</hi> that thoſe large Dominions ſhould be added to the Emperor or any of the other Princes. But then this is owing only to the ill conſtitution of the <hi>German</hi> State, which is ſubject to very great Commotions on the leaſt change. Let then thoſe Biſhopricks continue, and enjoy their large Revenues and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; only in the mean time let theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops remember that they are <hi>German</hi> Princes, and that they owe their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to the Liberality of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and therefore ought to love their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try more than the Pope: And let them put an end to their longing deſires after thoſe Biſhopricks they have loſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more think of regaining them, for fear in the attempt they ſhould alſo loſe what is left them; and however, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them not to embroil their native Country in any more deſtructive Wars and Quarrels. In truth, in the laſt Age it would not have been ſo difficult to have brought the Biſhopricks of <hi>Germany</hi>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:54100:120"/>
into a better ſtate than how they are, if either the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> had not miſcarried in his deſign; or if more of the <hi>German</hi> Biſhops had conſpired with him in the ſame intention: For after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſunk to ſo low an ebb, it would not have been difficult to have turned the Biſhopricks into Hereditary Principalities, and to have aſſigned the other Revenues to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Prebends; or if this had not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, theſe Principalities might have ſtill paſſed from one to another by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Nor are the Proteſtants of ſuch ſmall and contemptible Parts or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, as that they could not have employed theſe Revenues to the ſame uſes the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> do, if they had thought fit to have ſo continued them. It had been more alſo for the Peace of <hi>Germany</hi> to have had the whole Nation embraced the Proteſtant Religion, than it was to have a part continue in the old, to diſtract the People by a diverſity in their Faith. And could any man drive out of the Empire thoſe lazy Drones the Monks, and the cunning Companions of the Society of the Jeſuites, <hi>Germany</hi> would thereby be delivered from a Sett of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Spies; and the Revenues they waſtefully devour, would be ſufficient to maintain an Army that would defend <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> againſt both the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>WeſternTurk.</hi>
                  </q>

                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:54100:120"/>
When I had heard this Diſcourſe out, I was in an horrible fright for the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> but that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it was underſtood in vain by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, who could indeed pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſpecious Counſels, and aſſume great Courages under the Covert of their private Walls: But then, as long as thoſe that were born to <hi>command</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> others were for the moſt part beholden <hi>to</hi> their Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for giving them more Wealth than Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I thought again their Ignorance of what was their true Intereſt, and for their good, would ſtill ſecure it. This, Sir, is what I have in my Travels obſerved, concerning the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> and having thought fit to ſet it down in writing, I perſwade my ſelf, that if I miſs of Praiſe and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, yet at leaſt the Candor and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my Relations will deſerve pardon.</p>
